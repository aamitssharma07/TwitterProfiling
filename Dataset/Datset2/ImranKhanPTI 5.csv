congratulations to abid zuberi on his election as president scba
we saw a foreign abetted regime change conspiracy taking place sending pak into chaos but senior judiciary continues to remain aloof when will the judiciary move to act against state institutions that are defying all laws amp violating the constitution it is high time they did
amp safeguarded against excesses by the state amp govt we have seen citizens politicians journalists amp human rights defenders intimidatedarrested charged with terrorism amp incitement to mutiny torturedwe see fake cases misuse of power by different executive branches expanding
arshad sharifs murder has sent shockwaves across pak it has highlighted an ongoing targeting of anyone who dares to criticise or question those holding powerwhen will our senior judiciary act to ensure our citizens fundamental rights enshrined in the constitution are protected
my prayers and condolences go to his grief stricken family
a proper judicial investigation must be instituted to examine his own statements plus evidence that other sources have we have descended into a state of brutality unknown in civilised society indulged in by the powerful against those who dare to criticise amp expose wrongdoings
shocked at the brutal murder of arshad sharif who paid the ultimate price for speaking the truth  his life he had to leave the country amp be in hiding abroad but he continued to speak the truth on social media exposing the powerful today the entire nation mourns his death
saddened to learn of young pti tiger taha sheikhs death on th oct he was shot in front of his house in what looks like a targeted hit taha  succumbed to his injuries amp passed away sindh police has yet to arrest the culprits my prayers amp condolences go to his family
"strongly condemn the attack on pti karachi president mpa bilal ghafar by ppp goons lead by their mpa saleem baloch

everyone must turnout to vote in all the constituencies where bye elections are being held today this is a referendum for haqiqi azadi from the cabal of crooks we are contesting against all of pdm the election commission and namaloom afraad
my greatest worry is that apart from leading us to economic ruin amp with nro for themselves giving a license to white collar criminals to plunder the country this govt will also end up completely compromising our national security
"across the world when has pakistan shown aggression esp postnuclearisation equally impthis
biden statement shows total failure of imported govts foreign policy amp its claims of reset of relations with us is this the resetthis govt has broken all records for incompetence"
which he dispenses according to our deeds those who have allowed the biggest criminals not only to evade accountability after stealing billions from the nation but to come to power again are destined to be humiliated
azam swatis custodial torture for a tweet on nro  is yet another shameful act in our history can torture amp intimidation make people respect any individual or institution the holy quran teaches us respect amp humiliation are solely in allahs jurisdiction
is responsible for the bugging amp who is leaking out the audios many of which are editeddoctored this is critical bec sensitive security issues are amp have been illegally recorded amp subsequently hacked implying confidentiality of paks national security has been exposed globally
the audioleaks are a serious breach of national security as they call into question the entire security of the pmo pmh as pm my secure line at my residence was also bugged we intend to go to court to estab authenticity of leaks amp then form jit to investigate which intel agency
above all they have given themselves immunity from their corruption cases worth  billion
"i thank our overseas donors who waited patiently while we were setting up an account to facilitate floodrelief donations details as follows

congratulations to crown prince mohammed bin salman on being appointed prime minister of the kingdom of saudi arabia your friendship amp support for pakistan is invaluable and with your vision you will usher the kingdom into a new era
tragic army heli crash in which  soldiers were martyred near khost harnai balochistan my deepest condolences and prayers go to the families of these brave soldiers
including three barrages conserving  bn litres of water for much needed aquifer of lahore rakh jhok initiated last yr is part of  acres of reforestation environment plan embankments will be built with innovative method of using natural soil to prevent flooding
tasked with converting dead capital into viable transactions channeling wealth generation for the country similar projects with immense potential will be launched across punjab leading to econ growth amp prosperity by providing multiple opportunities for domestic amp fdi
imported govt is completely directionless the only achievement of this cabal of crooks has been to get another nro for the billions they looted from pakistan the question the whole nation is asking is who is responsible for this conspiracy against pakistan
in terms of growth rate  industry agriculture employment construction exports remittances amp tax collection  at an all time high now pakistan faces unprecedented inflation hitting everyone unemployment food insecurity amp rupee in freefall
imf amp world bank reports show this imported govt has failed to prevent economy going into tailspin despite inheriting a stabilised economy moving on an upward trajectory this was reflected in the economic survey which identified our econ  performance as the best in past  yrs
their desperation led to their blacking out our telethon for flood relief today they raided senator saif nyazees home amp took away his cell amp computer imported govt amp handlers are pushing us to the wall i am warning them there will be consequences they will have to face
on the one hand imported govt telling us to stop doing politics bec of floods amp on the other hand they are increasing their level of harassment amp false cases against us persecuting journalists who give our views a voice suspending tv channels amp youtube to prevent my coverage
we know your cabal of crooks amp handlers are petrified of pti popularity but if you are not responsible for violating our constitutional rights amp int commitments on freedom of press amp speech then it is your responsibility to inform nation who is responsible for these actions
question for shahbaz sharif are you out of ptifear responsible for media gags on us threat amp violence against journalists amp fake cases against them forcing blackout of pti amp myself from tv amp youtube amp the callous act of trying to blackout my flood relief telethon
despite all this we managed to raise rs  billion in just  hours i want to thank everyone who pledged incl our overseas pakistanis especially those based in the us
this shows how petrified they are of our rising popularity amongst the nation also they know no one trusts them with their money given their record of loot amp plunder so they sought to deny fundraising to aid flood victims just to get at me amp my party unbelievable callousness
imported govt of cabal of crooks amp their handlers stooped to new lows last night when they tried to blackout my telethon for flood relief fund raising first they pressured channels not to air telethon when some channels continued to air telethon they threatened cable operators
"tomorrow our gujranwala jalsa will be  last of our present phase of haqiqi azadi movement i will announce the next critical phase at the jalsa imported govt amp its handlers are so petrified that nation is standing firmly behind pti they are desperately 
moving on minus  formula"
interested only in saving its looted wealth through nro this fascist govt of cabal of crooks amp their backers are willing to harm the interests of pakistan simply out of fear of ptis soaring popularity utterly callous amp unacceptable
imported govt is so fearful of the nation rising in support of my message of haqiqi azadi that they are imposing complete blackout of my speeches not only from mainstream media but also by blocking youtube digital censorship hurts entire it sector amp damages paks image globally
am following intense propaganda launched by pdm cabal of crooks against methis stems from their being petrified of ptis soaring popularity today in peshawar jalsa i will give proper reply to all those who have deliberately been distorting my words to malign meenough is enough
i just met my team amp am now devising a policy of how we can contribute to alleviate the suffering of the people of sindh from the devastating floods we will start by donating rs  billion from the funds collected from the telethon
in addition the three barrages that are part of ruda shall conserve water thereby recharging our depleting groundwater
in ravi city ruda successfully conducted tests to convert toxic waste water into water fit for aquatic life these treatment plants shall be the first of their kind on municipal level to convert ravi into fresh perennial body
as pakistan is ravaged by floods our people need to understand the disastrous impact of global climate change that results in droughts amp then floods its imperative that we bring major changes to our environment through forests dams barrages amp waste water treatment plants
congratulations team pakistan for a great fight back and win and for keeping your nerve under pressure this was a much needed morale booster for the nation at a difficult time
i want to thank the people of pakistan especially our overseas pakistanis for donating so generously last night in the three hours of our telethon we had pledges of rs  billion
let me make clear that our movement for haqeeqi azadi will continue alongside our flood relief work
"our senior ldrshp met amp we decided i
wld do international telethon to raise funds for flood affectees on monday night imran tigers will be activated to volunteer for relief work a comm under sania nishtar wil be set up to identify amp coordinate funds allocation based on needs"
strongly condemn arrest amp imprisonment of sindh oppsition leader ptis haleem adil shaikh simply to silence his voice by the zardari mafia haleem has a broken leg amp is on hunger strike in jail we demand his immediate release amp an end to his political victimisation amp torture
congratulations to mahmood maulvi amp team pti karachi for victory in the na  election today inshaallah we are moving forward in our movement for haqeeqi azadi
this is not only a gross violation of freedom of speech but also negatively affects the digital media industry and the livelihoods of many what they need to understand is that no matter what they do they cannot suppress the will of the people which is haqeeqi azadi
the fascist imported govt sunk to a new low today by banning live coverage of my speeches on tv amp then blocking youtube temporarily during my speech at liaquat bagh all this after continuous intimidation of  mediapersons amp taking channels off air earlier
after pemra blocked live transmission of my pindi jalsa speech on tv channels imported govt blocked youtube midway through my speech this just shows the desperation of those who for their self interest are willing to push pakistan towards political and economic chaos
we are on our way to winning karachi na  election our camps are full of voters while opposition camps are empty i am asking all our voters to go immediately to vote if they havent already done so
i am inviting everyone to join us tomorrow and raise their voice in protest
tomorrow i will be leading a rally after maghrib from china chowk to f park in support of dr gill amp in protest against the torture inflicted on him we will also be protesting against muzzling of ary simply bec ary didnt toe the official line amp gave coverage to our narrative
who tortured gill there is a general perception in the public at large amp in our minds too as to who could have carried out the gruesome torture remember the public will react we will leave no stone unturned to find out those responsible amp bring them to justice
meanwhile the likes of ns maryam mfr az all of whom have in the worst possible way amp repeatedly attacked state institutions through malicious amp targeted statements against them get away without even a hint of a reprimand
but also any such extraconstitutional amp extralegal actions being devised against us
to target me amp pti by forcibly getting false statements against us similar to what they have been doing against social media activiststhis is absolutely unacceptable we will take all legal amp pol actions to counter not only this torture being inflicted upon shahbaz gill
very concerned about shahbaz gill being sent into police remand again he is in a fragile state of mental amp physical health because of the torture inflicted on him when he was abducted amp taken to undisclosed location amp then again at the police station this is part of conspiracy
amp myself to succeed then we will be returning to the dark days of dictatorship when there was no independent media amp no room for freedom of expression haqeeqi azadi cannot be achieved without a free media amp freedom of speech as guaranteed in our constitution
others like imran riaz sami ibrahim ayaz amir have suffered threats violent attacks amp arrest in my mass public campaign across pak from next week i will take up issue of media freedom amp freedom of expression if we allow these terror tactics designed simply to target pti
i want to warn our nation of an unprecedented crackdown campaign by imported govt amp state machinery against media houses amp journalists who are carrying pti amp my narrative to the public two journalists arshad sharif amp sabir shakir have had to leave pak fearing for their lives
judiciary needs to take notice of this arys news editor was picked up violently late night from his home without warrant amp a wife with suckling baby picked up illegally bec her husband worked for gill a climate of fear is being spread to make ppl kowtow before cabal of crooks
strongly condemn the torture being inflicted on shahbaz gill under what law amp under whos orders is this being done if he broke any law then he shd be given a fair hearing but just to salvage imported govt of crooks the constitution amp all laws are being violated with impunity
imported govt of cabal of crooks brought thru foreign backed regime change is using fear amp terror in media amp ppl to gain acceptance after being routed in punjab electionsbut all they are succeeding in doing is further destabilising country only solution is fair amp free elections
strongly condemn fascist illegal abductions in shadows of late night of aamad yusuf amp now shahbaz gills assistant izhaars wife who is now incarcerated in women police station i want to ask our legal community are there no fundamental right anymore
this supreme sacrifice stands as a beacon of inspiration for all who fight for justice amp truth and against tyranny amp falsehood
facing a tyrants army that far outnumbered them imam hussain as with his family amp companions laid down their lives at karbala standing resolute for haq truthright against baatil falsehood
rule by a cabal of crooks amp their handlers brought to power through us regime change conspiracy will our ppl bow down before this conspiracy in fear or as a nation face up to the challenge on  aug at our haqeeqi azadi jalsa i will announce our plan to counter this fascism
people of kufa despite knowing our beloved prophetpbuhs grandson was on the path of truth did not come to help out of fear of yazid amp allowed the greatest tragedy of islam to happen every era has its yazids pakistan is facing yazidiyat fascism today in the form of
we stand with the brave palestinian ppl amp ask world powers to break their silence amp act against israeli atrocities committed on the palestinian ppl peace can only come through a viable twostate solution
israeli forces again launched air strikes against besieged palestinians incl childrenin gaza violating all int laws   israel is trying to use its massive mly power to subjugate the palestinian ppl amp eliminate those who stand up for their rights amp for end to israeli occupation
we are asked to echo condemnations on issues of human rights the powerful  in the int community take up but when it comes to india amp its massive human rights violations in iiojk there is complete silence by the same powers bec of indias market or its strategic mly partnerships
but the kashmiris spirit of resistance became stronger amp it continues to strengthen the selective morality of the international community amp silence against indias brazen violations of all int laws amp un sc resolutions is condemnable
on  aug  modi govt violated un sc resolutions amp int law by illegally revoking special status of iiojk modi govt then moved to commit a war crime under fourth geneva convention by altering demography of iiojk they assumed the moves would crush spirit of kashmiri resistance
today i am calling all our people to come out in peaceful public protest against cec amp ecp in f park at  pm i will be addressing the gathering between    pm

these ppl have been plundering pak for last  yrs amp are now responsible for the present economic meltdown these thieves should never be allowed to sell our national assets in the devious manner they are attempting the nation will never trust them with our national assets
i can say with certainty after my interaction with our nation amp their response to my call for haqeeqi azadi that ppl of pak  have had enough amp will not allow these mafias to continue their loot amp plunder we are not far from sri lanka moment when our public pours out into streets
"in just over  mths the zardari  sharifs mafia has brought the country to its knees politically amp economically
 simply to save their illegally accumulated wealth amassed over  yrs of plundering pakistan my question ishow long will state institutions continue to allow this"
they must now protect their mandate by coming out to protest today across pak i will address the protests at  pm tonight let sri lanka be a reminder as a clear message goes to cabal of crookstheir handlers amp ecp that people wil not allow you to steal their mandate in punjab
now the kings of crime zardari amp ss having gotten their nro are using their salvaged looted money to purchase punjab mpas making a mockery of laws amp desecrating our constitutioni am asking ppl of pak that just as they came out amp thwarted plan to steal punjab election on july
imported govt brought in by us regime change conspiracy first tried to rig punjab bye elections thru govt amp state machinery abetted by dishonest amp biased cec sikandar sultan heading non credible ecp a highly aware amp resolute public stood firm ensuring failure of nefarious design
isnt destruction of our democracy constitution amp nations morality a fit case for suo moto action are the neutrals not realising how our beloved country is literally being destroyed on all fronts by the imported govt brought in through us regime change conspiracy
after fed govt toppled with stolen money from sindh amp nro achieved certified criminal asif zardari in cahoots with sharif mafia now seeking to steal punjab ppls mandate by trying to purchase mpas want to ask honourable sc are they not cogniscant of the damage being wreaked
this is not only an attack on our democracy but also on moral fabric of our society had sc taken action amp debarred these turncoats for life it would have acted as deterrent dont handlers of us regime change conspiracys imported govt realise severe damage being done to nation
today lahore is seeing a repeat of the sindh house horse trading that happened in islamabad with upto rs  crores being offered to buy mpas the main architect behind this is asif zardari who gets nro for his corruption amp purchases people with looted wealth he shd be jailed
the nation will hold accountable all those responsible for regime change conspiracy amp bringing pakistan to this sorry state of affairs
when us regime conspiracys vonc was tabled  was at rs  today it is rs  amp in freefall despite imf agreement the economic meltdown shows sharifs never had any expertise in running economy or administration their only expertise is looting money laundering amp getting nros
the only way forward from here is to hold fair amp free elections under a credible ecp any other path will only lead to greater political uncertainty amp further economic chaos
as results coming in pti is winning in atleast  seats but it is very important for all our people on duty in all polling stations not to leave their posts till official results have been obtained from the returning officers
today punjab govt has brazenly violated sc orders amp election rules by openly using all govtstate machinery to rig punjab elections through illegal ballot stamping amp harrassing voters while arresting pti ldrs through it all ecp turned a blind eye courts must open now amp act
strongly condemn illegal arrest of shahbaz gill simply to try amp rig elections amp spread fear in ppl these fascist tactics will not work amp our ppl will not be deterred from exercising their right to vote handlers of imported govt should realise damage they are doing to our nation
i am pleased to see our voters coming out to cast their votes in large numbers amp resisting all pressures amp harassment i want all those esp our women who have to still come out to cast their vote to do so as this is an election for pakistans sovereignty amp haqeeqi azadi
i extend my congratulations to president erdogan amp the people of turkiye on democracy amp national unity day of turkiye demokrasi ve milli birlik gn  july  commemorates the day president erdogan with the support of the turkish people defeated attempted coup against him
rains have once again exposed  years corrupt rule of zardari amp family in sindh this is a classic example of how corruption ruins governance money given to karachi ended up in fake accounts and invested in dubai properties this nexus of evil must be brought to an end
flooding of karachi bec of rains again a reflection of ppps  yrs of corruption amp mismanagement in governing sindh my govt had given rsbn to clean amp reconstruct major nullahs but prov govt failed to perform its task of improving solid waste disposal amp cleaning minor nullahs
wishing muslims everywhere eid mubarak as we celebrate amp thank allah for his blessings this eid that commemorates sacrifice let us remember amp pray for those who are without their loved ones amp for the people of iiojk amp palestine suffering oppression under brutal occupation
but all this is doing is stoking a dangerous slide into anarchy by pitting the people against the govt
i am afraid neither the pdm parties who have perfected the art of rigging over the years want free and fair elections nor does our establishment
unless we all unite and stand up against this fascism it will be the end of democracy and freedom in pakistan
all those who support democracy amp the right to freedom of expression as enshrined in our constitution must come out amp protest against arrest of  amp ongoing violence amp targeting of journalists incl  amp many others just to instil fear amp silence critical voices
i strongly condemn the arbitrary arrest of  by punjab police tonight the country is descending into fascism just to make our nation accept an imported govt comprising of mega crooks it is time for everyone esp the media to unite amp stand up against this fascism
this was despite the sharp slow down after regime change conspiracy operationalised in july march  under pti govt exports grew  in june under cabal of crooks export growth slowed to
the nation continues to suffer crushing economic cost of imported govt brought in thru us regime change conspiracy at a time when our govt had stabilised the economy exports which stagnated in previous pmln govt at  bn crossed  bn for the first time this yr to  bn
i condemn in strongest terms the violence against senior journalist ayaz amir today in lahore pak  descending into the worst kind of fascism with violence amp fake firs against journalistsopp politicians citizenswhen the state loses all moral authority it resorts to violence
inshaallah tomorrow will be our historic islamabad jalsa at parade ground against imported govts pol destabilisation amp crushing our people under the burden of excessive loadshedding in peak of summer amp spiralling fuel prices i will be leading a rally from pindi to parade ground

a great loss for the ummah"
my condolences amp prayers go to the govt amp people of afghanistan for the loss of lives suffered in the earthquake i have asked the kp govt to especially facilitate provision of all medical assistance
rs  bn of the rs  bn that was being investigated by nab will now be out of nabs jurisdiction giving this criminal mafia their nro history will neither forget nor forgive all those who were part of amp enabled this conspiracy against pakistan to succeed
our prophet pbuh had said societies are destroyed when the poor are jailed while the rich are not held accountable today with this one amended nab law we are heading towards destruction by removing white collar criminals from accountability
at a time when our economy had stabilised amp was moving towards sustainable growth of  the conspirators chose to destabilise pak by sending economy into a tailspin amp dropping a price bomb on our ppl  just to give these criminals nro
today is black day in paks history when imported govt of crooks amended nab law comes in ending accountability entire economy amp pol system of pak was derailed thru usbacked regime change conspiracy simply to give this cabal of crooks another nro pmlns dastgir confirmed this
i am confident that prerequisite onsite visit of fatf team to confirm completed work on our action plan will pass successfully too hammad azhar members of his fatf coord committee amp officers who worked on this task performed exceptionally well the whole country is proud of you
fatf repeatedly praised work amp the political will my govt demonstrated we not only averted blacklisting but also completed  out of  action items we submitted compliance report on remaining  items in april based on which fatf now declared paks action plan as completed
i constituted a fatf coordination committee headed by key minister hammad azhar the committee had representation from all govt departments amp security agencies relevant to our fatf action plan the officers worked day amp night in the first instance to avoid blacklisting
pak was nominated for grey listing by fatf in feb  amp had to complete the most challenging action plan ever given to any jurisdiction when my govt took over we faced dire prospect of blacklisting by that body our past compliance history with fatf was also not favourable
sadly another wave of inflation is coming as rupee devalues further  has fallen  rs  to the dollar since imported govt of crooks came to power through us regime change conspiracy
police amp local administration have become complicit with this mafia amp had unleashed a reign of terror on peaceful pti workers ldrs amp their families now they feel they r not answerable before the peoples elected ldrship we cannot allow such anarchy amp criminal rule to prevail
ever since imported crime ministers corrupt son illegally grabbed power in punjab thru a farcical election there is complete political anarchy in paks most populous province people suffering farmers crops under threat no governance in sight just a criminal mafia running riot
the indian govt chose to target the muslim protestors by demolishing their homes this inhumane fascistic action is utterly condemnable amp straight out of the israeli playbook
shocking how indian officials demolished the homes of indian muslims protesting against the blasphemous statements of bjp spokesperson against our beloved holy prophet pbuh instead of showing sensitivity to their muslim citizens who along with muslims worldwide were deeply hurt
"given the special needs of tribal districts my govt had increased their  funding by x to rs  bnimported 
govt has budgeted only rs bn reduced dev funding  allocation for displaced persons amp  increase in current budgetshows incompetence amp ill intent of govt of crooks"
and on the other hand retard economic growth due to high interest rates all our progressive tax reforms and propoor programs such as sehat card kamyab pakistan are being shelved it is an unimaginative purana pakistan budget creating more burdens amp misery for the nation
we reject this anti people amp anti business budget presented by imported govt budget is based on unrealistic assumptions on inflation amp economic growth todays spi of  indicates that inflation will be between  which on the one hand will destroy the common man
saddened to learn of the passing of our mna aamir liaquat my condolences and prayers go to his family
this attack on our holy prophet pbuh is the most painful thing anyone can do to muslims who feel an intense love amp reverence for our holy prophet pbuh oic must take strong action ag modis india bec sadly so far india has been allowed to get away with its islamophobic policies
strongly condemn the hateful attack by a bjp spokesperson on our beloved holy prophet pbuh modi govt has been deliberately following a policy of provocation amp hatred towards muslims in india including inciting vigilante violence against them
this afternoon i will be addressing a jalsa in buner where i will be pointing out how imported govt is a willing tool being used by us regime change conspirators esp those foreign interests who want to cause economic chaos amp hardship for our people amp weaken the state of pakistan
i want everyone to come out amp protest peacefully after juma prayers tomorrow against this imported govts antipeople policies of massive price hikes to crush the public amp wreak economic havoc in the country since they have no stakes here as their assets are all abroad
our govt sustained pressure of covid amp gave rs  bn worth economic package this yr alone we reduced sales tax to zero percent amp additionally provided rs  bn energy subsidies to protect our public for us our priority has always been our people
imported govt has increased petroleum prices by  or rs  per litrethis will increase burden on the public by rs  bn amp price hike in basic necessities plus the rs  increase in electricity price will put entire country into shockexpect inflation by  highest in  yrs
this cabal of crooks poses a far more serious threat to pakistan than any of our external enemies
the nab bill amendment is basically an nro amp will destroy the anti corruption drive in pakistan for all times to come all cases against ns ss amp az will be closed ampa new round of mega corruption will commence
scp must take suo moto notice to ensure fair trial by appointing a monitoring judge to oversee all mega cases of politicians as it is  months have passed amp fia court has failed to frame charges this speaks volumes for how big thieves exploit amp manipulate the system
scp was brazenly lied to by fia when they stated before the scp that special prosecutors were laid off as they remained absent when in fact special  prosecutors had been present on al dates before the fia court
crime minister trying to interfere in his amp his familys money laundering cases by altering record thru friendly prosecution fia on behest of crime minister has taken back challan for supplementary reference for altering it to destroy the case in toto
what i witnessed during my  hours on the container btwn am amp am on th morning confirmed what i had been sensing since this imported govt was imposed on us through a foreign conspiracy that pakistan has changed foreverthe mental shackles of slavery have been broken finally
congratulations to kazim khan on being reelected president of cpne i believe cpne can play a major role in responsible journalism and will protect peoples right to know and freedom of speech
in contrast india strategic ally of us has managed to reduce fuel prices by pkr  per litre by buying cheaper oil from russia now our nation will suffer another massive dose of inflation at the hands of this cabal of crooks
nation starting to pay price for imported govts subservience before foreign masters with   rs per litre hike in petrol amp diesel prices  the highest single price hike in our historythe incompetent amp insensitive govt has not pursued our deal with russia for  cheaper oil
my heartfelt condolences go to the families of our two martyred pti workers faisal abbas chaudhry from lahore amp syed ahmed jan from mardan as a result of punjab police violence during our peaceful azadi march pti will take full financial responsibility for their families

strongly condemn the continuing fascist tactics of modi govt against kashmiri leader yasin malik from his illegal imprisonment to his conviction on fake charges international community must act against the hindutva fascist modi regimes state terrorism in iiojk
ppp pmln and jui marches against our govt were never stopped nor did we carry out any crackdown on their  workers this is the difference between democrats and kleptocrats
already economy is in a tailspin i want to warn the crooks amp their handlers that these undemocratic amp fascist steps will further exacerbate the economic situation amp push the country into a state of anarchy
peaceful protest is the right of all our citizens the brutal crackdown on pti ldrs amp workers in punjab amp islamabad has once again shown us what we are familiar with  the fascist nature of pmln when in power the present crackdown also raises serious questions abt the handlers
i strongly condemn the political victimisation of journalists arshad sharif sami ibrahim imran riaz khan through fake firs by the imported government brought in through us regime change conspiracy this is absolutely unacceptable

strongly condemn haleem adil sheikh leader of opposition in sindh being subjected to victimisation by ppps fascist rule false terrorism firs registered ag him his house raided twice amp family harassed pti workers amp relatives arrested from his house

centuries ago our holy prophet pbuh set up the first welfare state in madina based on rule of law meritocracy compassion amp tolerance amp where quest for knowledge was made a sacred duty in a couple of decades muslims became the greatest civilisation for next few centuries

that led to a dangerous military adventurism to win an election in utter disregard for the consequences of destabilising the entire region pakistan averted a larger crisis by a responsible measured response to balakot yet modi govt continues to turn india into a rogue state
in  i spoke at unga on how indias fascist modi govt used the balakot crisis for domestic electoral gains  latest revelations from communication of an indian journalist known for his warmongering reveal the unholy nexus between the modi govt amp indian media

the last thing the world wants or needs is further polarisation public statements based on ignorance will create more hate islamophobia amp space for extremists
through encouraging the display of blasphemous cartoons targeting islam amp our prophet pbuh by attacking islam   clearly without having any understanding of it president macron has attacked amp hurt the sentiments of millions of muslims in europe amp across the world

hallmark of a leader is he unites human beings as mandela did rather than dividing them this is a time when pres macron could have put healing touch amp denied space to extremists rather than creating further polarisation amp marginalisation that inevitably leads to radicalisation

i want pakistanis at home and abroad to come out on th feb in support of the  million kashmiris who have been besieged by k indian soldiers for almost  months by the fascist racist modi regime
i want to make clear to india and the international community that if india continues its military attacks killing civilians across loc pakistan will find it increasingly difficult to remain an inactive observer along the loc
as indian occupation forces continue to target amp kill civilians across the loc with increasing intensity amp frequency there is an urgent need for un sc to insist india allow unmogip return to iojkside of loc we fear an indian false flag operation
jampk dispute must be resolved in accordance with relevant un security council resolutions amp the will of the kashmiri people we will continue to provide moral political and diplomatic support to the kashmiri people until they secure their inalienable right to selfdetermination
pakistan welcomes un security council discussing the situation in jammu amp kashmir again an internationally recognized dispute jampk remains on the security councils agenda amp its consideration by the council reflects a recognition of the seriousness of the prevailing situation

i want to congratulate ig punjab shoaib dastgir and the punjab police for successfully going after hardened criminals in the province this has sent a positive message of a new culture of zero tolerance in the punjab police for criminals
in contrast modis rss vision supports minorities oppression amp the targeted attacks against muslims are part of this agenda rss goons conducting public lynchings muslims being violated by mobs are all not only supported by modi govt but indian police leads antimuslim attacks
the major difference between the condemnable nankana incident amp the ongoing attacks across india on muslims amp other minorities is this the former is against my vision amp will find zero tolerance amp protection from the govt incl police amp judiciary
given the extremely cold weather conditions i have asked cms of punjab amp kp to ensure that no person is left out without shelter amp their administrations must take immediate action to provide temporary shelters plus food for those who cannot be accommodated in existing panagahs
all our young aspiring leaders should make our quaid their role model he was sadiq amp ameen amp his year struggle was not for personal gain but to achieve a homeland for the muslims of the subcontinent where they could live as free citizens second to none
today on quaidiazams birthday we as a nation must resolve to build pakistan in accordance with his vision of an islamic welfare state based on compassion amp human dignity justice amp rule of law amp a plural inclusivist society
wishing all our christian citizens a happy christmas
i have been warning the int community of this for some time amp am reiterating again if india does such an operation to divert attention from its domestic chaos plus whip up war hysteria to mobilise hindu nationalism pak will have no option but to give a befitting response
at the same time the siege by indian occupation forces in iojk continues amp a bloodbath can be expected when it is lifted as these protests are increasing threat to pak from india is also increasing indian army chiefs statement adds to our concerns of a false flag ooperation

our govt has increased the eobi oldage pension by  from rs to rs within a yearthis helps us provide pensioners security in their postretirement yrs much of this contribution comes from improving the institution itself another step towards madina ki riyasat
will lead to massive bloodshed amp farreaching consequences for the world as in nazi germany in modis india dissent has been marginalised amp the world must step in before it is too late to counter this hindu supremacist agenda of modis india threatening bloodshed amp war
all this accompanied by mob lynchings of muslims amp other minorities in india world must realise as appeasement of the genocidal supremacist agenda of nazi germany eventually  led to wwii modis hindu supremacist agenda accompanied by threats to pak under a nuclear overhang
india under modi has been moving systematically with its hindu supremacist agenda starting with illegal annexation amp continuing siege of iojk then stripping  mn indian muslim in assam of citizenship setting up internment camps now the passage of  citizenship amendment law

we will establish a comprehensive amp enforceable code of conduct learning from the best practices in internationally renowned universities so that we can restore amp enable student unions to play their part in positively grooming our youth as future leaders of the country
universities groom future leaders of the country amp student unions form an integral part of this grooming unfortunately in pakistan universities student unions became violent battlegrounds amp completely destroyed the intellectual atmosphere on campuses
also for the record i have the greatest respect for cj khosa one of the greatest jurists produced by pakistan
for the record  yrs ago we were the first party to advocate an independent judiciary and rule of law in  pti was in the forefront of the movement for independence of the judiciary amp i was jailed for it
mafias who have stashed their loot abroad and seek to protect this loot by destabilising the country

as the world watches the worst violation of human rights in iojk modi is now fearful because he knows the moment the siege is lifted there will be a bloodbath  which would be the only way to subdue the kashmiri people
days amp occupation government of modi continues the siege in iojk modi is riding a tiger  he thought he could get his agenda of annexation by using k forces to silence kashmiris you dont need k troops to fight terrorism you need them to terrorise m kashmiri people
as committed to them by the international community through unsc resolutions
for over  months with a complete blackout of communications thousands imprisonedincluding entire spectrum of political leadership plus children amp a growing humanitarian crisis in iojk k kashmiris have been killed over  yrs fighting for their right to self determination
i am puzzled as to how international  media continues to give headline coverage to hongkong protests but ignores the dire human rights crisis in iojk  an internationally recognised disputed territory illegally annexed by india with k troops imposing a siege on mn kashmiris
as committed to them by the international community through unsc resolutions
a narrative that tries to divert from the indigenous kashmiris struggle against brutal indian occupation by trying to label it as islamic terrorism being driven by pakistan it will give india an excuse to increase violent oppression of kashmiris in iojk amp attack across loc
i understand the anguish of the kashmiris in ajk seeing their fellow kashmiris in iojk under an inhumane curfew for over  months but any one crossing the loc from ajk to provide humanitarian aid or support for kashmiri struggle will play into the hands of the indian narrative
pakistanchina relations have gone from strength to strength amp cpec is a reflection of our mutual commitment to this enduring relationship
today on the th anniversary of the peoples republic of china i want to extend our nations greetings to our true amp steadfast friend china i have always admired chinas development amp fight against corruption
misperceptions which bring people together against muslims would be corrected issue of blasphemy would be properly contextualized series amp films would be produced on muslim history to educateinform our own people amp the world muslims would be given a dedicated media presence

qadirs bowling statistics do not do justice to his genius had he been playing cricket now with the modern drs system where batsmen can be given out on the front foot as well qadir would have gotten as many wickets as the great shane warne
deeply saddened to hear of abdul qadirs passing my prayers amp condolences go to the family abdul qadir was a genius one of the greatest leg spinners of all time and he was also the life of the dressing room entertaining the team with his wit amp humour
the world cannot feign ignorance as it did at munich in  the fascist hindusupremacist design of the modi govt with its ethnic cleansing amp genocide of muslims agenda in iojk in india itself assam amp beyond into ajk is now overt for all the world to see
indias violation of all international laws including humanitarian laws is there for the world to see so why is the world silent is the international communitys humanity dead when muslims are being persecuted what message is being sent to the  bn muslims across the world
hospitals have run out of medical supplies basic necessities are in short supply but a communication blackout has deprived kashmiris a voice to the outside world amp their families despite this tales of horror are finding their way into the international media
today is the nd day of the siege of iojk by the indian occupation forces of the modi govt under cover of this siege indian forces have killed injured with pellet guns abused kashmiri men women amp children men have been taken away amp thrown into prisons across india
the mti actordinance is to enable improved amp modern management of public sector hospitals this is not privatization but part of our public sector hospitals reform planthe hospitals will remain govt hospitals better managed hospitals will mean better facilities for patients
on behalf of the people of pakistan and myself i extend our warm wishes to the president and the people of uzbekistan  on their th independence day
the pakistani nation has also let the world know about the nazistyle takeover of india by the rssbjps hindu supremacist ideology amp the danger it poses not only to the region but the world
i am so proud of our people in the way they came out today in solidarity with the kashmiris  letting them know our nation stands resolutely with them as they confront the brutal fascist modi govts annexation amp ethnic cleansing agenda in iojk
we must send a strong message to kashmiris that our nation stands resolutely behind them so i am asking all pakistanis for half an hour tomorrow stop whatever you are doing amp come out on the road to show solidarity with the kashmiri people
the daily injuring amp killing of kashmiri civilians incl women amp children  all part of the ethnic cleansing agenda of the modi govt amp its illegal annexation of iok the plan to change demography of iok is a war crime under th geneva convention
i want all pakistanis to come out tomorrow  noon  pm to show solidarity with the kashmiri people and send the kashmiris in iok a clear message that the entire pakistani nation  stands in solidarity with them amp against indian fascist oppression the inhumane day curfew
i want to warn the international community that the indian leadership will in all probability attempt a false flag operation to divert attention from its massive human rights violations amp the  unleashing of a reign of terror in iojk
we are hearing indian media claims that some terrorists from afghanistan have entered iojk for terrorist activities while others have entered indias southern regions these claims are predictable to divert attention from indias ethnic cleansing amp genocide agenda in iojk
"the indian occupation forces have even denied them their right to observe their religious practices including eid ul azha
as the world shows solidarity for victims of violence based on religion amp belief it must also move to prevent an impending genocide of kashmiris in iok"
today on the st international day for victims of violence based on religion or belief we call attention to the plight of millions of kashmiris living under brutal indian occupation abuse amp violence deprived of all fundamental rights amp freedoms
the govts consistent focus on reducing our external imbalances by reducing imports amp increasing exports amp remittances are bearing fruit current account deficit reduced by more than  bn last yr amp july this yr deficit is  or  bn lower than july   a great achievement
the hindu supremacist modi govt poses a threat to pakistan as well as to the minorities in india amp in fact to the very fabric of nehru amp gandhis india to understand the link between nazi ideology amp the ethnic cleansing amp genocide ideology of rssbjp founding fathers just google
the world must also seriously consider  the safety amp security of indias nuclear arsenal in the control of the fascist racist hindu supremacist modi govt this is an issue that impacts not just the region but the world
already m indian muslims face detention camps amp cancellation of citizenship world must take note as this genie is out of the bottle amp the doctrine of hate amp genocide with rss goons on the rampage will spread unless the international community acts now to stop it
and the threat also extends to pakistan the minorities in india amp in fact the very fabric of nehru amp gandhis india one can simply google to understand the link between the nazi ideology amp ethnic cleansing amp genocide ideology of the rssbjp founding fathers
india has been captured as germany had been captured by nazis by a fascist racist hindu supremacist ideology amp leadershipthis threatens m kashmiris under siege in iok for over  weeks which shd have sent alarm bells ringing across the world with un observers being sent there
and the unsc meeting was a reaffirmation of these resolutions therefore addressing the suffering of the kashmiri people amp ensuring resolution of the dispute is the responsibility of this world body
i welcome the unsc meeting to discuss the serious situation in occupied jammu amp kashmir it is for the first time in over  yrs that the worlds highest diplomatic forum has taken up this issue there are  unsc resolutions reiterating the kashmiris right to self determination
that is why the hindutva exclusivist creed of the modiled govt with its fascist tactics in iok will fail miserably in its attempt to smother the kashmiri liberation struggle
the fascist hindu supremacist modi govt should know that while armies militants amp terrorists can be defeated by superior forces history tells us that when a nation unites in a freedom struggle amp does not fear death no force can stop it from achieving its goal
will world silently witness another srebrenicatype massacre amp ethnic cleansing of muslims in iok i want to warn international community if it allows this to happen it will have severe repercussions amp reactions in the muslim world setting off radicalisation amp cycles of violence
in iok  days of curfew presence of extra troops in an already heavily militarized occupied territory sending in of rss goons complete communication blackout with the example of modis earlier ethnic cleansing of muslims in gujarat
i have directed all mnasmpas of karachi to be in their constituencies throughout eid amp independence day holidays amp provide all assistance to the ppl the federal govt is drafting a comprehensive package to end the decades of neglect amp suffering of the ppl of this gt metropolis
i am afraid this rss ideology of hindu supremacy like the nazi aryan supremacy will not stop in iok instead it will lead to suppression of muslims in india amp eventually lead to targeting of pakistan the hindu supremacists version of hitlers lebensraum
the curfew crackdown amp impending genocide of kashmiris in iok is unfolding exactly acc to rss ideology inspired by nazi ideology attempt is to change demography of kashmir through ethnic cleansing question is will the world watch amp appease as they did hitler at munich
what should be obvious is the int community will be witnessing the genocide of the kashmiris in iok question is will we watch another appeasement of fascism this time in the garb of bjp govt or will the int community have the moral courage to stop this from happening
the whole world is waiting to see what happens to oppressed kashmiris in iok when curfew is lifted does the bjp govt think by using greater military force against kashmiris in iok it will stop the freedom movement chances are it will gain momentum
president trump offered to mediate on kashmir this is the time to do so as situation deteriorates there and along the loc with new aggressive actions being taken by indian occupation forces this has the potential to blow up into a regional crisis
it is time to end the long night of suffering for the people of occupied kashmir they must be allowed to exercise their right to self determination according to un sc resolutionsthe only road to peace amp security in south asia runs through a peaceful amp just settlement of kashmir
i condemn indias attack across loc on innocent civilians amp its use of cluster munitions in violation of int humanitarian law and its own commitments under the  convention on certain conventional weapons unsc must take note of this international threat to peace amp security

in order ro have a winning offensive strategy sarfaraz must go in with specialist batsmen and bowlers because raillu kattas rarely perform under pressure  especially the intense kind that will be generated today  unless pitch is damp sarfaraz must win the toss amp bat
all fears of losing should be banished from the mind as the mind can only process one thought at a time fear  of losing leads to a negative amp defensive strategy amp crucially mistakes by opponents are not pounced upon so here are my suggestions for sarfaraz amp pakistan team
today given the intensity of the match both teams will come under great mental pressure and the power of the mind will decide the outcome of the match today in sarfaraz we are fortunate to have a bold captain amp today he will have to be at his daring best
when i started my cricketing career i assumed success was  talent amp  mind by the time i finished playing cricket i felt it was  ratio but now i tend to agree with my friend gavaskar its  mental strength amp   talent today role of mind will be more than
