new trailer released at comiccon today
lets go
first fulllength trailer
ouch inflation is far too important a problem for the white house to keep making statements like this its either straight ahead misdirection or a deep misunderstanding of basic market dynamics
nice happy fathers day to your fathers too
thank you
i love you dad
stewart i very much hope the future world gets many more hucksters like you we will be better for it
incredible
since i have a cuban dad am i a legacy american or is that too soon are my kids the framework doesnt make sense
yes a strong scent non legacy american is so intellectually bankrupt
what a truly beautiful observation
thanks for the history shout out here many twists and turns and failures and successes in those  years
no not really like that he rob hof was just reporting accurately the general wall street sentiment in fact same reporter wrote a follow up ten years later that kind of follow up is pretty rare in my experience and commendable
i have this old  businessweek framed as a reminder the risky bet that wall street disliked was aws which generated revenue of more than  billion last year
thank you ive been working hard on my ass
seen you refer to yourself as a shtposter but maybe youre mostly just a wiseposter
agree with you its sad
if youre looking for some scary bedtime reading
liked because i believe youre  right
their best to add another  trillion to federal spending they failed but if they had succeeded inflation would be even higher than it is today and inflation today is at a  year high
look a squirrel this is the white houses statement about my recent tweets they understandably want to muddy the topic they know inflation hurts the neediest the most but unions arent causing inflation and neither are wealthy people  remember the administration tried
"years ago yesterday amzn went public as the grateful dead would say what a long strange trip its been

its been far from smooth lots of risktaking lots of invention lots of mistakes so much we still have to do better i wouldnt trade the ride for anything"
in fact the administration tried hard to inject even more stimulus into an already overheated inflationary economy and only manchin saved them from themselves inflation is a regressive tax that most hurts the least affluent misdirection doesnt help the country
the newly created disinformation board should review this tweet or maybe they need to form a new non sequitur board instead raising corp taxes is fine to discuss taming inflation is critical to discuss mushing them together is just misdirection
ha honesty and directness best bet
thank you
space squirrels are real
for most things six pages
happy about that thank you

slide decks are maybe useful for persuasion  think sales calls but you dont want that for internal decision meetings
