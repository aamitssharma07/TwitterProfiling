helping them prepare is your job the  is how we are in charge of children not in control of them
yes next week the children speak
i think  is  saying its not supposed to be a struggle
such a powerful  what unconscious message are you sending to your child about life
toughest job on earth but also the most sacred holy  creating other human beings and guiding them to themselves
thank you there with hotels
drshefali yep i think a lot of parents want their kids to be puppets do just what they want when they want it
that was a good moment do you all agree my fear of repeating it is exactly whats causing it
you are so right children feel the energy of your heart before you speak
must we always repeat what was done to us
i know hard to hear easier to think what youre fighting about is the problem  it never is  for anybody in any relationship
glad god gave me that job millions easier than    thats why i marvel at people who have  and  and more
great pointchildren are our greatest mirrors  children are coming to us to be ushered and guided
i have the deepest respect for parents who are doing their best to be conscious no question its the hardest job on earth
why do you react the way you do to your kids what are they triggering for you  gives solid answers
calling all parents some good stuff for yall on own right now with
everywhere the moment you land at airport india

god is live streaming right now is the stream and  the cart and buggy god  is all
looking forward to

good idea thanks
god is the laptop and the speed
it is the reason why i asked  how are you going to figure out who you are

everybody needs to take some time to listen to your heart   this should be our main takeaway from today w  u all agree
honoring my own tears today for madiba  sadness and celebration
didnt you mean ability and not inability
supersoulers  that is our common ground making oura zone of peace doesnt the idea of that feel like a prayer
part of quieting yourself is to honor the tears that you carry thanks for that beautiful reminder
i too  treasure  that rumi poem  guesthouse
you knew that already just a reminder  we can start anew
yes  youre so right a lot of people get their hearts  broken by family  to heal we learn compassion
loved that one too about fear being the cheapest room in the house
most memorable watching winnie mandela hold graca michels hand at gravesite and wipe away her tears
compassion  meditation and mindfulness  love those as systematic ways to free your own heart
i was surprised to learn buddhism is more a practice than a belief were you

you can never have an impact on society if you have not changed yourselfhumility is the most important quality
he said this many times  it was not just me  it was team work
he was a personal mentor father figure and friend
this mandela interview makes me so proud i couldnt see it at the time was too anxious and nervous

going to his family home for final resting place
if i had not been to prison i would not have had the opportunity to change myself nelson mandela got it no experience is wasted
i feel blessed to have had this time with him
oooonooo

hi jaqueline your brother  is bringing it tonite
this is not judge judythis is lifeclass thanks
loved that too
preaching the truth too often we dont cut to the root of the issue different love language
if you dont find a way to love a flawed person secretly youre teaching yourself that youre not loveable because of your flaws
when you hold on to your history you do so at the expense of your destiny  one of my top five quotes of all time thanks
attack the issue not the individual loved this one too
if you succeed in loving imperfect people it means theres room for them to love imperfect you   loved this too

steveperry every kid joins a gang to feel love
yes dont you love karlton and his six sons he just kept knocking on the door wouldnt give up
i believe fathers not showing up for  their sons has left a hole in the soul of our country
boom that was it forgive your father so your son can forgive  you
how can we break this cycle thats the question this lifeclass  asks
i think they do know better they just don t know what to do to make it better
what gets me is fathers act like they dont realize what theyre doing to their sons when it was already done to them
i was too this young boy represents a world of sons
just show up for your kids
fatherless sons  so heartbreaking this son coming up next
that makes my heart sing
downstairs hes been up for  hrs me and dogs just getting up
honey i know this is true but can you come take the dogs out     that would be a winwin for me right now

"makes me so angry  when women choose men over their daughters

mothers day lifeclass addresses moms using their kids to get even with dads
yes lose thanks for the correction

wakeup call
i  hope we start a revolution of fatherless sons reclaiming their children please join me next week
another characteristic true
you cant u only have power in your own life none in your mothers or fathers
agree game over
this is your wakeup call
no victims are usually naive and unaware and non confrontational
you get to define your boundaries its a decision
decide what you want the relationship to be and let every choice move u in that direction
so true hardest to manage are family baiters
its a mistake we all have made holding onto the dream u wished the person was
keep listening just say no
a real friend i would tell someone i was just friendly with i would not
big aha coming up u miss the person u wished u were in relationship with
is  saying the same thing as maya when people show you who they are believe them the st time
loved that one never invest more than you can afford to loose applies to everything
so true
dont we like the word baiters so appropriate for what it means

in the absence of love and belonging there will always be suffering
watching from guam

chicago
i may be making a mess  but im not messy  a child shall lead them

shame depends on me buying into the belief that im alone thanks
thanks for reminding me here with my sa girls
aha a minute right
cool is the emotional straight jacket loved this one too

unused creativity metastasizes first aha from
sadie did  poops but im here

preciate it back to bed for me tweet party
thank u ireland i wish more people knew it was live streamed im looking forward myself
and why r u awakesadie has the poops too much chicken just took her out
years in journalismwow a lifetime of lessons from a true master tonight
physical reminder
very very different calming vs stimulating
only visited once
no need to get sick
i watched him cut and do the eye scraping and then he handed me the knife knife was definitely real
stressing  the opposite of meditation
cutting or eye scraping
catch her next week phenomenal indeed
maya opens new season of  in may
jesus said where  or  are gathered in my name so u definitely feel the current  of all that praying
good question i was told some people request the physical surgery like guy i interviewed  from sweden
thanx
meditation is like developing a muscle you get better with practice observe your thoughts
i know i spoke to about his surgery
morning mostly  but last nite before bed
that woman did sound a little nutty
no one is watching everyone sits with eyes closed in prayer and silence
yes similar but jesus didnt use a knife the knife was real  i felt it
impression was how powerful it was to sit in the current of prayer and peace and hope it was undeniable
my first time meeting him
blood has never made me queasy before or since
when he cut that woman her blood was dripping onto her shoe i nearly fainted
you do at nite not morning
to be clear john of god says he does not heal  god does the healing thru him
hey girrrrl that was fun
so glad to hear it doesnt feel like an old friend
my big take away this sunday you dont get to criticize if youre not in the arena thanks  see you all tonite for john of god
i love all of them  but this struck a big nerve  more next week
so grateful to be able to share this platform and commune with you all thank you my tweethearts
this was one of biggest ahas ever for me practice gratitude in that moment when you feel afraid thanx
when we loose our tolerance to be vulnerablejoy becomes foreboding   how many of you have done that
that surprised me that joy is so terrifyingthanks
what would you dare to do if you knew you wouldnt fail build the own network thanx for asking
god is the divine reminder of our inherit worthiness this struck a truth nerve for medid it resonate for you
so good worth the effort if you got it
when u start sharing you realize everyone else has a version of your story you are never alone
loved that video short of dogkatie so much to see
its the word grandmother  thats throwing me
we shifted and internalized our fear that was big aha for me do you all agree there is a thin film of fear wrapped around us
share your whole story with your whole heart dont buy into the hustle
change your hearts desire to how you can serve the universe with your talent youll have a better outcome
youre so right  learned this the hard way  being there more important than what you say
was that an aha for yall too that men feel so vulnerable initiating sex    fear of being turned down
howie you know this better than most vulnerability is cornerstone to confidence
havent we all lived that moment of not knowing what to say to a friend and saying nothing then feeling bad about it
our connection was immediate you can see it and feel it right has that ever happened to you tweethearts

judy smith the real olivia popeso right about tiger woods scandal you agree

you guys had  million viewers thursday congrats that is the light shining on you
i love  ass background checks every woman in business should adopt that policy
yaaaaay join the party
i know its not right do you all want olivia pope with the prez

yes what langston hughes called seed of the free gods dream within the dream of every slave
thats so true i cried  you didnt
talking to you like sitting in a room of sunshine so energizing  thanks for your thoughtful responses
but olivia pope women didnt even have the right to vote
why could i weep because every free woman is the answer to a slave womans prayers
whipping scene in  hard to watch also hotbox
saw  since i did interview  broomhilda couldnt even have dreamed olivia pope
hard not to have good chemistry with   am i right
here i am tweet tweet

going out to enjoy the daysee ya tonite
the death of one child makes no sense the death of millions how could it  thank you elie wiesel
so good for you
didnt realize how many times i said unimaginable
tonite at  ctrl on own
yep for me too shoes and babies clothes hair was kinda freaky
and the book is
noisy lots of fa la la that is romantic
look how sad these shoes arethey are crying
and  girls waiting to go back to college
the babies were killed immediatelyevery human being should read night
amen to that
crusephoto all the suitcases haunting and especially the shoes
this whole interview was a prayer an offering for the world to see and declare never again
great to hear
standing at that wall also strong memory
not that we lived with the death we lived inside the deathdeath was the norm elie wiesel
vastness of the camps it was a city designed for the production of killing people
his last word my name elie wiesel speaking of his father
everyone brings there personal resonance to everything
can you believe those death camps  and that their clothes were never allowed to be washed
fans see you tonite for tweet fest with  and the real olivia pope
quite possibly a great gift are u coming with her
love that elie wiesel just said his favorite words are and yet no  matter what happens  and yet
youre toward the back of book not there yet be assured i will be reading during holidays gift a day
and  just finished your letters
still reading  gift  can  only take in a few letters at a time my favorite thing ever so well done
i know but i wonder if sociopaths even feel karma when it comes around
i actually get heart palpitations looking at all those books
friendship is like a religion exactly how i feel about my true friends thank you elie wiesel
can we live like every moment is a new beginning and every word is a prayer
notice
the potters housewhenever im in dallas
tell me whyi should follow you
loosing all of his money to madoff did not make elie wiesel pessimistic or bitteramazing dont you think
can you believe madoff stole from elie wiesel we have seen worse
filmed  on real slave plantations overwhelming experience
slavery was an oppression factory just as holocaust was a death factory both we must never forget
life is not a fist its an open hand elie wiesel the question  can we be an open hand for each other answer
love  harderwow thanx now thats a mission statement
new mantra for lifethink higher and feel deeper  did you all receive that message too
yes
fantastic elie wiesel looked up and saw his father while receiving  nobel prize
i still believe in man inspite of man elie wiesel
and ayana mathis is a writing star
yep  dogs on sofa at my feet masala chai perfection
do all the characters feel like people u somehow know
i dont like the ndes that take you to hell much prefer the white light  supersoulsunday
where are you in book now
hard to believe that all he went through living even in death that coming to the end he eliewiesel was still afraid
yes doing nothing is the worst
did you download  yetlet me know when you get to floyd   will definitely need a bookclub tweet fest
we are the human species if one individual changes it changes
for sure regret for a life not lived did you download twelve tribes of hattie yet
i  know i ask that question at  will i still be asking at  have i done enough elie wiesel
my visit to auschwitz was life altering st time elie wiesel showed me picture of his little sister

"wow that was so powerful and the truth for so many men in prison and out  i didnt 
know how to be a father"
so good at showing the patterns like father like son that was great
the  sisters   just saw that show today wow dont miss  next week
you have already lost your children but you can build a new relationship with them everyone always wants what was instead of what is
must be painful for a father to hear his son say i had to be the man in the family
when did you abandon you  loved this one too
isnt this so needed

the lesson noise of the world will make you crazy if you cannot find the center

why does it matter what its labeled obviously he was in a manic state and remained so for  weeks
you always say that about every interview  where do you think hes not telling the truth
lord knows didnt the people turn

everybody has a purpose bigger than themselves if youre only serving yourselfsmall life
you dont have permission to disrespect me can serve in a lot of situations thank you
yes everyone please note i wrote throwns and should have said thrones my error i know better brain fart

if you cant receive feedback from your crewthis ship is going down
you cant empower unless you have the power
putting the cards on the tablelorrrdy
how you be in yourself determines how you show up in the room
we put our hurt on each other thank you for that
say heeeey to everybody
so true thanks for the correction
this is what women need to do speak the truth to the people who hurt you instead of going behind their backs
women abdicate their throwns  all the time with bad behavior the way we treat each other
i luv  being  all friendly then going in for spiritual surgery
getting ready for an autopsy on the six brown chicks

"truth is people do the best     
they can and daisy and kris will do the best they can"
love back
i knoooowww just found out two days ago when previewing this show  i thought she would at least try
gotta sayi was surprisedthought she would try and follow through and see her kids
you are so right so sad that parents abuse the trust
i love that even daisy could speak of her intention
never gonna happen
based on what youve seendo you think the mother will keep her word to see her children
another lesson if you want kids to talk especially boys have to engage them in activity
the reason this show impacted mefirst time i learned that parents just leave and tell the children nothing
daisy said she didwho do you believe
anatomy of a nervous breakdownis what i call that show  this sunday
have taped
speak the truth steve but also true a great body of work that oprah show so proud of what my team and i were graced to do
love great vibes
will look into it thats where my favorite guest of all time came fromthat book half the sky
the real problem was that kris caught a glimpse of his mom as he was walking down hallway and then had a breakdown
in sync
for sure even she said it
isnt this something
the person i wanted to talk to most in past  yrs other than oj finally sits down w me on  c
and thats a wrap  terrance howard and me in our goodbyelove scene thanks lee daniels for the great expe
jason russell kony  so honest about his break down  next sunday

real family connection after interview entire family showed up
sure loved sitting on that porch with ya
mayyyyybe
i was nervous  not sure which colbert would be doing interview
both are true
fun and funny i agree
are you at home now watching   love from your new black friend
rude u
u need a bigger dream if a tweet can make your life complete
ultimately only you can judasyourself no matter how someone treats you u get to decide how to react
thats what truth does you can hear again and again and this info gets better with time
loved  definition of godmystical law
this i found is the key to surrender knowing when youve done all that you can and then surrender the outcome
when you betray yourself you betray your whole life and everything in it
not a fight to get there its a flow surrender all
i surrender all my  spiritual practice
glad to see ure ahaing
love that aha for you were never not on the path
dont agree
when you have an opportunity to protect yourself and you choose otherwiseu are no different than the people who hurt you
bet there were a lot of ahas with that one anyone feel like youve betrayed yourself
so happy to hear
was my favorite you know youre on the right path when you dont have to betray yourself anymore
this is one of my favorite  s could watch it over and over so many ahas for me
have no judgements and no expectations about your life and give up the need to know what happens
will reveal soon going back to finish my book g nite to all tweet tweets
happy birthday
screen all shows produced by harpo before u see them
key question what do you want put your big girl panties on and do what scares you
next week backstabbing sistas  gets to the truth of how we treat each other
every episode so real thank you
healing only begins when you speak your truth she was afraid of her mother son is afraid of her
agree but can u see the patterns the broken place she comes from and keeps breaking others
why r u saying that
loved this momentwhere you gonna sleep tonite this is so gooood
wow youve been without yourself for  yearsyou need to be whole for you theyre going to be ok
is it just me or is this great tv
are yall shocked by her truth she wants out
either show up whole and complete or dont even bother
brighter days ahead
why havent you watched
wow wasnt that good yall  calling the whole thing a thing
loved that one too isnt that good
great for calling her on emotional mother trick
u can stop now
uh oh getting real now your mother left youthat is awkward boo
did u just say its her th attempt to come home
r u watching
how many of us have done that  and thats why she was able to stay yearsnot calling a thing a thing
why should he have warm feelings for a wife and mother who left

no sari socks and sweats
talk about family tradition yrs   yrs  yrs married all in one house
garlic nan my favorite not so much cactus
i now think differently about them understand why it works they not marrying for love intention is to build strong family
if your husband has parents you move in with them rich or poor the family in  slumthat used to be his fathers house
flat screens and cell phones big statussymbol
father has a cell phone yes i have stayed in touch
was truly life enhancing experience as you can see
lisa ling is there now
yep and no shower head just buckets
family told me they love saturdays cause they get to sleep in
there was a tiny fan over door that we brought no  way to heatbut hot plate that sits above my head but notice  flat screen
main camera was on edge of door one step into neighbors house
that was hard  having the children see their father cry
yep even in the slums and this child dont you love her
"the family of  in that one room that beautiful little smart girl anchal
youd loose ur mind taking photos"
this was the most incredible thing to me that all  live in that room
value of family is major priority not just talk they live it youll see coming up soon  generations in one house

i paid for my whole team to learn but you can learn without paying a cent start with one minute and expand

i did it and failed so much better than woulda shoulda coulda
did already today gayle even flew in for banana pudding and pear cobbler
yes and fascinating
i wish i could clear my mind enough to try it thats exactly the pointyou recognize you are not your mind
i think youd have a lot better schools those kids were  amazing so is the navy seal who is talking now
i was so impressed with these kids who taught me a thing or two about meditation and staying centered
i dont think its strange at all the most peaceful place ive ever been
me too sean watching  right now in hotel with sheri
i ll see you there
i think you just spoke an untruth
have not heard that rumor but no kid deserves to be shot unarmed
tragedy and shame that zimmerman hasnt been arrested
in st louis preparing for lifeclass show tomorrow  can see the arch from my window would take a pic but not as good as you
all my new friends in fairfield iowa youre an inspiration
we are spiritual beings having a human experiencealso one of my favorite quotes
in order to manifest anything you have to be in alignment  amp  on
so hard not to be judgmental and human
how do you like the interview i am doing with  on   i like a lot are you up already in maui
gnite all
yes  and i think its a good thing when people are outraged by injustice it speaks to our humanity apathy is an enemy
ok so youre right skittles

really  did this just happen
when youve suffered a loss like hers youre super vulnerable dont know if its true
funny haha lol ol
would you
nice that your mama shared
i would interview all sides including the people who just saw him at store where he bought the skiddles
i ask for the truth dont always get it you the viewer decide
what window  where tweet us a picture
fair enough twana youre an attorney im in television i want him to talk to me
i would be happy to theyve already spoken to all media zimmerman no one can find
yeah he does
anyone whos lost a loved one knows their pain id interview them too but want the eyewitnesses amp zimmerman
once hes arrested interview becomes almost impossible til after trial i want to speak to him now
the roughest since abuse trial in south africa
gonna live stream it next sunday the whole  hrs
to get an interview with zimmerman dont you want to hear him speak the truth do you think he will
yes i see you
for sure and that wall hurts
thanks steven i loved doing it  and now love her she is the truth
i know its a problem depends on your cable package something i knew nothing about before i started the network
that was such a surprise her keeping a grateful journal
i hear you john
agree
its repeating now
i agree  was profoundly good on this interview so real i see why she has  million twitter little monsters
i am thrilled rare to have a star be that open and real and honest
thats the point    your brilliance matters
she answered by her actions  great inspiration for parents of creative kids
lot a love for her
i think she is a great teacher and modern prophet thru her music and message
never to old to be conscious and own yourself
didnt u love her describing creative process
should have waited  more day said the same thing to  beyonce first time she was on producers werent happy
now m twitter followers
was an all paws up experience
she thinks out of the box about everything
shes a genius for real behind all the show and bizpure creative genius
not surprised but moved by intelligence amp connection to family
agree she does a great job no kidding about the sleep a couple of wks ago we were on phone amp she fell asleep
where will you be watching  tonite   called and you werent home
will you be able to stay up and watch gaga   or early to bed for cbs
gonna stick with the ipad  until i see a reason to change i really like it
thanks u look ok even with nose shot
not tweeting anybody whos devastated turning
so good couldnt fit into one hour
means people can be love and give love when theyre motivated what a fun social experiment
and yes youre right about changing the description just checked it out
but i came to to town a month ago and told ya it was much more than dating rev
wasnt julianne moore transformed into sarah p
the criticism is all a part of the yin and yang of notorietyive supported them publicly and privately and will continue
fully support themit takes money to make films and then distribute for free to stay committed even when no one was listening

this cant happen to both of uswhitney referring to michael js drug use rememberingwhitney
for some reason i always had a fight in me  rememberingwhitney on own
this is so sad sadder than i remember during interview  on own
i prayed if you give me one day of strength  i will walk out that door whitney on own
agree ashley i was there and it feels deeper to me now than even then
he cut my head off the picture he started to paint evil eyes on the walls i felt something was going to blow on own
i was so weak to him he was my drug  on own
somethings wrong  why arent we talkingi didnt know about the largeness of being an icon  remembering whitney on own right now
havent watched this since i did interview  on ownforgot she in detail the volumes of cocaine she did
i thought i liked viola before but after that interview i love her exactly how i felt when i finished interview
"goodnight every bodythanks for watchingthe oscar special 
you is kind you is smartyou is important"
i dont want any crutches in my life anymore
true for us all when you remember where you come from the divine you have supreme confidence and humility
shes preaching now yall when you walk into a theatre you want to experience a human event
everything that has happened whether devastating or joyful i need to embrace it all
i appreciate love  friendship  a homei suffered from low self esteem for so long

love that seuss one of my favs too theres no one alive who is youer than you so why do so many try being  who they r not
tell her to carry a microphone
the things that make you happy may not look good to other people
we were their dreams dont you love that
isnt viola great in this interview talking about her fear of what could  be perceived as mammy role  we were their dreams
these women brought their openness and such grace thats what youre feeling  wait violas up next  blew me away

yep stand corrected forgot the g ying and yang
its not apart of our genetic makeup to be happy for each others success its something you have to learn viola davis
