true
to be clear i am generally profbi recognizing of course that no organization is perfect including fbi

its gonna be great
dont want to jinx it but spacex is positioned to grow strongly no matter what macroeconomic conditions are like
suggestions are welcome

any account doxxing realtime location info of anyone will be suspended as it is a physical safety violation this
realtime posting of someone elses location violates doxxing policy but delayed posting of locations are ok
up to  days for human review

one day of twitter suspension  death
twitter right now is
my plane is actually not trackable without using nonpublic data
no you
if theyre naughty they get suspended

twitter too no doubt
thats the goal
next week
so theyre saying  its really bad to suspend people from twitter
woohoo
community notes expands
agreed
absolutely
you first lol
seems fine to me
exactly
unsuspend accounts who doxxed my exact location in realtime
sorry too many options will redo poll
if anyone posted realtime locations amp addresses of nyt reporters fbi would be investigating thered be hearings
unsuspend accounts who doxxed my exact location in realtime
words to live by
"yeah we will add that feature current system isnt clear

a time"
accounts engaged in doxxing receive a temporary  day suspension
day suspension for doxxing some time away from twitter is good for the soul
they posted my exact realtime location basically assassination coordinates in obvious direct violat
i love barbara streisand lol
criticizing me all day long is totally fine but doxxing my realtime location and endangering my family is not
same doxxing rules apply to journalists as to everyone else
yup recent events make that super clear
so few understand this
twitter obviously must be fair to all so will aim to stop violent extremism being promoted by any group
correct
exactly
true
changing name or profile pic causes checkmark to disappear until account is reviewed by twitt
olbermann tweeting from his dogs account still makes me lmao
quite frankly a few days away from twitter is good for their mental health
its a rental
i dont have a home
interesting this seems to have happened in every country
such a tangled web
strange priorities
"securities analysis 

as the riskfree real rate of return from treasury bills approaches the"

twitter will start incorporating mute amp block signals from blue verified not legacy blue as downvotes
"the people have spoken

accounts who doxxed my location will have their suspension lifted now"
indeed there is no other reason
umm  yeah
ultima v for me
such shameful behavior will not be tolerated going forward
too many people have lost faith in the future a new philosophy is needed

what should the consequence of doxxing someones realtime exact location be
the tide is turning fast for the faucists
good questions
much has happened since then haha
much closer than they realize

in addition twitter will make it easier to see tweets from just those you follow as well as other tweet curations
wikipedia is overly controlled by mainstream media
if a group of accounts engages in brigading the entire group of accounts will get a credibility score of
if an account engages in largescale blocking the value of a block signal from that account will trend to zero
a two day suspension of maybe  accounts for doxxing got an actual wikipedia page wikipedia
to be clear all user actions will factor into a nn model for a tweet and the account tweeting including positive
the question is not finding a ceo the question is finding a ceo who can keep twitter alive
should i step down as head of twitter i will abide by the results of this poll
going forward there will be a vote for major policy changes my apologies wont happen again
pauls account will be restored shortly
policy will be adjusted to suspending accounts only when that accounts primary purpose is
ok that seems reasonable
what do you think should be the policy

but shouldnt there be some funding in this bill to secure us borders given that we
exactly
we shall see
is this true  and
twitter is rolling out view count so you can see how many times a tweet has been seen this is normal for video
what utter insanity that tens of billions are being spent for border security of other countries but none for ours
at the risk of being repetitive these fed rate increases might go down in history as most damaging ever
hes great
