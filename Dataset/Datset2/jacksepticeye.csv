band aid for a bullet hole really fantastic piece of tech but shouldnt be on me to fix
sure but id rather youtube fix it up top first instead of us having to do the work
you know son we really are the avatars
spam comments
you can i could turn them off completely but it would cancel out genuine people who wanna interact with my videos
its ridiculous how awful its gotten used to be fun to interact with fans on videos but now everyone avoids it
"not your fault man 
maybe one day comments will be worth reading again"
how this stuff makes it passed youtubes filters ill never know there are methods of preventing this but they just dont want to do it the top ones are especially vile

now that elon bought twitter can he get minecrafters to stop ratioing me

"it is a good day and all shall smile upon you and say lets go

thank you for personally delivering the win haha appreciate you man
so many wonderful people raising money for terrific causes each year thank you all for voting for me it means a lot
perfect
youre the final boss of elden ring
you looked awesome fuck racists
holy shit
bf vibes miss those days too
i knew it
your ass deserves the best
you went up against a professional comedian you didnt even stand a chance
i use the same joke twice and i get roasted for it
i go twice as long in a meet and greet for my fans only to get roasted by them
banger tweet
exactly how it felt
eh probably i feel like i did alright for myself regardless haha
for sure i always assumed i had it but felt weird saying that without official proof
after being curious about it for years i officially got diagnosed with adhd today suddenly my whole life makes a lot more sense
i do a nice thing for someone and i get roasted for it
so happy to be part of this
enjoy it man
ok now youve convinced me
twin sword dex build tried not to summon much so i could learn the bosses
its always hit and miss in these games either op or completely useless lol
radahn or big snake man
its way too good downs every boss in a couple of rs
beat elden ring twice now mage build with moonveil katana and mimic made the game super easy didnt use the mimic first playthrough but it feels sort of op
yes to the latter you fought the baby version
best average height but still close to being tall guy i know is what you meant right
thats my elden ring character
what an incredible fundraiser ill never forget it
yeah er leans heavy into magic based weapons compared to dark souls
thats really not that crazy considering some of the later weapons reqs
now you better win or well both look dumb
why would you be weird for drinking gods tears its delicious
definitely the most diverse game theyve made in terms of mechanics its crazy the amount of combinations you can do
who wants my bean juice
i use bean juice blaster on the regs
you must be having a field day with all of the move sets in this game
the system works
whoa this is incredible work look at him
adorable great colours too
but if i notice it then youll stop
now were talkin
far more than i deserve but i appreciate everyones support over the years
any one good at editing wanna make this
i fucking hate math
this was genuinely one of the best things about the tour
shoutout
i got it in hampm in amsterdam thats all i know
gotta appreciate all zones
yes im working hard on getting it out fast after the live events
at the time yeah but it was due to me still learning the show looking back it was a really fun energy to have
incredible
irish people love rain
i told you guys i was a comedian
theyre the best
me too everytime i watch the doc i miss it so much
we go again

we tried lol
more screenings of the documentary are still happenig later today if you missed the first one you can still catch it
madness
lets gooooo
also holy shit
hahaha
literally crying haha thank you for such a lovely reception to the documentary it means a lot to me to finally have it out in the world and for people to have seen it
it was one of my fondest memories
the lore runs d e e p
a
jacksepticeye hate that guy
im so proud of my family
please use the hashtag if you want to talk about it ive been reading them all and love hearing your thoughts on it
it was easily the best venue so unique
if you couldnt make one of the time slots for the doc you can still watch it up to hrs after the premieres
its documentary day excited for you all to see it please let me know what you think and share your thoughts with
paper towels considering how much water will have to be mopped up
dude i loved that fight what a spectacle
haha yeah the tweet to slime was a joke
duuuuude thats sick im so envious
please watch only tommyinnit tiktoks
hours spent playing in total i still missed a lot of stuff games massive
in total about  hours
elden ring complete what an incredible game
i said id never go back there man
last boss in elden ring is absolutely kicking my ass been stuck on it for like  hours now im so close
putting us all to shame
"youre running out of time to get tickets to the tour doc 
i even went back to my childhood house for a visit in it"
no worries it was incredible i cant wait to see more d
he cost a fortune and was a total shithead the whole time never again
our best photo shoot yet
please dont ever tell me to swallow again
fantastic voice work man
"bloodborne is the easiest to get into less mechanics to worry about like equip load and armor stats etc 
elden ring has too many options and ways to go for a brand new player to the genre it gets really confusing"
the voice work is phenomenal in it
im  hours into elden ring i think im near the end now but man it just keeps going and going its way bigger than i expected ive been loving every minute of it
absolutely deserved game had incredible audio and not enough people were talking about it
horse combat kinda stinky though
been on the sigma male grindset for years
mins
top of the mornin to ya
easier to snap selfies with the volume button
its like a dream come true to be able partner with elden ring for our new cloak drop go get some before theyre all gone
if youre playing elden ring all weekend then youre saving yourself
when they release the remake ill do it
aw what a sweetheart
welcome back j money
damn i wish i was  hours into elden ring it would make me a better person
this one is a toughie much harder than ds for me so far but exploration is dope
i no longer have a life i just have moments in between elden ring
be prepared its absolutely massive im like  hrs in and have probably double that to go
"itll be very intimidating if you havent since it blends everything from their old games
i still think its fine to start here though"
easy
"i know im a massive fan of these games but elden ring is genuinely one of the best games ive ever played 
the amount of stuff to see and do is nuts"
id swap the last  and that would be mine well for now
jaccuse
v  me in the lands between geoff

goodbye everyone
very pogchamp

"just showed the tour doc to my friends here they loved it

fantastic game
"happy valentines day  i hope you feel loved today even if that love has to come from yourself treat yourself 
evelien surprised me"

ayo thanks so much everyone means a lot to still be here and have a community thats this supportive over the years
bang on answer
i can hear the ratios coming
yeah i saw some people play the game today but i cant until tomorrow cos of a different embargo so weird
for sure knowing your limits and when to duck out and do something else is a start constantly reading about other peoples thoughts on everything is exhausting
i mean his bro did say he watched my uncharted  playthrough years ago just sayin
by not staying on the internet as much anymore constantly viewing the world through my phone or computer screen made me a lot more cynical
if this video doesnt get  million views now ill blame you
big tick
monday
i guess i shouldnt be sarcastic lol
starting a lets play channel with tom holland
hungry
even people who do know what theyre talking about nfts are giga cringe regardless
this is exactly how i talk too
bimday
dont give me hope
yes but not exactly how people will expect
well im sold
oi bruv
constantly looking at my own open mouth
this will tell you how memorable the movie was lol
the facial expression this tweet just made me do
armed goro rock here we go
the king is back
wait what by this logic most jokes are misinformation lol
congrats man thanks for helping out creators so much during your time at yt
weeks
omg yesssss ive been thinking of doing a bloodborne playthrough lately
really thought they were gonna end an episode with that shot and leave people hanging for a week lol
and id do it again
spot on
weird way of saying good friend
what in the backwards fuckery
this make me do a pee pee
buy my coffee
this is a screenshot i cant listen to that
what about cat photo nfts
as you should be its amazing
yes hes fucking awful
this is legitimately cool haha
literally now its ten times worse
if it means all the bullshit with them last year gets shifted to a more positive working space then yes for the entire industry and becoming a monopoly of dev studios probably not
happy birthday molly
oh boy now youre playing my favourite game cant wait to watch you suffer
with variable refresh rate and auto hdr
honestly hope the biggest thing in all of this is that management changes and harassment gets fixed
enjoy
what the absolute fuck biggest acquisition ever
if only they cared about the original harassment to you as much as this
incredible
you fell off catch this l
had to retweet your own tweet cos no one agrees sad
got it in  eat shit chris
absolute maniac
moments before you get destroyed by a horse man in love with a glowing sword
look the alignment was fine on desktop ok what do you want from me
how the fuck does mobile mess it up this bad
i love your content                i hate coffee
isnt the fact that this even exists still a huge problem sold or not
felt that with mandalorian most of the time too honestly
gettin close tho
ah man that sucks some people cant handle women just doing whatever they want and having fun
"in this household we respect strong successful women 
the amount of harassment they have to go through online for just simply existing is crazy"
we must all fight for the rights to potato planet
cant wait for more
this is adorable
please dont shoot me
this is so cool
shoot the child
hell yeah
no u
brb moving to potato planet
clean up clean up
as long as elden ring stays put well all be fine
i feel like a lot of games this year will get delayed
omg i want one
youll be hearing from my lawyers
pussy money and weed
how does liking a video of someone doing realistic animatronic moves turn into sexy fancam edits of glamrock freddy
mine is full of people drooling over andrew garfield cos i liked spiderman tiktoks
i know youre pure of heart
ive come to the conclusion that tiktok is entirely too horny
enjoy
attack on titan is back today as someone who has read the entire manga im curious to see how people react to the coming plot lines
pretty crazy that it runs this bad on a  but hopefully they patch it
amazing
happy birthday buddy
hope you get through it quickly man rest up
really thought we all learned something back then especially when lawsuits were drafted against some people
people always forget about smaller creators too when bigger creators push the limits when the adpocalypse happened on youtube it was the smaller channels that got ruined by it same thing will happen here if it keeps going big channels will live but smaller ones get fucked
im literally just a parrot
whoa cool
happy birthday rae
modern day socrates

lets run it
more drunk among us
lets goooooo
i live in spain but the s is silent
hope the move went well dude
not weird at all man growth and fame are always the goals people strive for in this career but it definitely comes with a lot of baggage i think your thought process is healthy honestly
niiiice ive been trying to learn how to play recently but i stink
story and characters wise is was just alright but man some of the shots in it are dope i really liked it overall
"i have never found the workaholic lifestyle a d gloating about it even remotely healthy its gross and shouldnt be idolised 
work hard for sure but know your limits and pumped the brakes when needed"
i cant believe someone actually said that to him over a simple misunderstanding i  agree with what he said in response
thank youuuu
cosindering most other studios turned them down to animate this final season due to complexity i think mappa deserve huge credit for taking on such a massive task
happy birthday
yeah id argue its not even worth that price for casual vr players the difference between rift s and index arent big enough for the price difference
valve index is technically the best for all the bells and whistles with great controllers but the rift s is not far off it and is much easier to setup rift stuff is facebook though and theyve made things a real pain since quest  came out
top of the morning tim
congrats america

great read hank
uh oh stinky
playing among us with some friends
literally my reaction
undertale is  years old this month
one thing i want to add though is that i think money can definitely bring about a lot of good change in the world in a charitable and humanitarian way doesnt really relate to long term personal happiness but still worth mentioning
"true happiness and peace never come from an external source actual long lasting happiness is found and generated from within
that being said money can definitely make that path easier and avoid a lot of really hard obstacles in life"
thats when i started uploading uhoh

meadbh saoirse or tadhg would really fuck with people
fs for him haha
im a proud irish man no john allowed
lol i can imagine
also sen is gaelic for john
we have similar sounds but not the exact one from jean i could be remembering wrong
because its irish and actually spelled sen for me personally originating from the french jean but we didnt have the j sound in irish the accent over the a is called a fada and it elongates the vowel sound
cute
i would love that
joel christmas album when
et tu plier
what the absolute fuck
i loved watching bill burr rip into joe rogan about it
ron the legend back at it again
oh absolutely i think the cleanse of awful people in this industry is good and necessary the stories coming out are heart breaking to read
tell her i say hello back
im so excited to finally have more of it
cory imma need more of these bloopers please
how many of these meme reactions do you guys have haha
the internet has been fucking exhausting lately
"im glad i am able to kick people right in the blood stream 
so glad you like it d appreciate the support"
perfect haha
the legend returns
"cancel the possums

also you guys better stop being nice to me or else"
wow i cant believe redacted said such nice things about my coffee
i would very much like to play this game
"seriously i saw cancel sean and panicked haha
this is way too sweet and i dont deserve it but i sure as hell appreciate the shit out of you guys"
this is very sweet
cuntdestroyer
jesus im so sorry this happened
the thing is those are all just other people opinions just like you have yours if a lot of people liked it then cool if a lot of people despise it then cool none of us are right thats not how art works
why do people need to make up theories for why i liked it if you didnt thats fine it has parts i didnt like at all but overall in the end i enjoyed it
and thats perfectly fine i can definitely see why a lot of people didnt like it
i can see where some people would get this idea but i also got days gone early from sony and shat all over it and couldnt even play it
really enjoyed your video on it
it was terrific
yes overall i think its a great game
youre still super far off haha
only every  mins
its a long game i ended up at like hrs play time
"i finished tlou yesterday im really curious to see how people react to it as the series progresses i wont spoil anything here since my full thoughts are at the end of the last episode 
for those curious itll be  episodes in total"
god damn youre so fucking good
so glad you liked it
so they just lost all their jobs too jesus
im so sorry to all the streamers who made their living on mixer thats crushing to just see it end in a tweet randomly
i told people that youtubers all share the same brain cell lol
i hope so too
i really wish it was the opening to the game then when ellie counts down for blast off it cuts to jesse waking her up for patrols
mother of god insane numbers congrats man
fascinating stuff the sound design in this game is some of the best ive ever heard the mixing and localisation of sounds is amazing
new ego
definitely should someday soon
this is for a panel im doing talking about charity with some other panelists its next week
this is sick
dont apologise it was still a fun memorable moment haha
thanks for coming to the vidcon digital meet and greet it was so nice seeing you all even though it was so brief i appreciate you taking time out of your day for it im glad we get to do something like that in the middle of lockdowns
the detial and lighting in this game is nuts
omg
its just a middle phase i promise
eboy lookin ass
yall prepared to die this playthrough
happy birthday bruv
i gotchu baby
nah you good some people take these things too far but thats not your fault

i love it
my biggest series of the year starts now
get out of my head
finally
check your crops too
nice teet
pog
take care of yourself dude
yer a wizerd
good update
just coinciding with modern gaming
some updates on where were at with coffee
i love you
happy birthday dude
love it
thats cold phil
ill bill you for the tissues i go through
cant hear over the sound of how much early access i got
be gentle
can i play with your dog
thursday actually
would love to know what you think fellow coffee fiend
top of the
oh shit
we must ask the meme elders
not this haha
good luck in your job search
will you be drinking ass from it
true but were bot going anywhere so people can focus on their own stuff first and well be waiting if they want
and we really mean it
the world is full of odd things
maybe
me too lol
how many beans
we will be adding tea and hot chocolate down the road
definitely took the wind out of my sails a bit but i spent all yesterday talking about it with people well see what we can do i dont want to over promise and under deliver
as soon as we can we got far more orders than we thought so were gonna work on it as fast as possible its a small team haha but it shouldnt be too long people need their beans
normally it would be fine but the climate right now makes it hard to keep ahead of it plus people bought way more than expected which is cool but yeah i want people to be able to actually get it lol
sure thing bud
trying our best to get it back in stock the coffee is easy but getting those bottles is proving to be a pain lol
trying to ship a food item fast for freshness as well as heavy liquids is hard to do overseas but were working on it as we speak hope to be able to ease it a bit in the future
thanks man
first day of coffee launch has been nuts you guys exceeded even our wildest expectations haha thank you so much were working on restocking stuff but of course covid has messed up a lot of things lots to do and learn from but im excited for the future
its been crazy thank you
workin on it thanks for the support man
we do not and these were our reasons why
wishing you well man sorry it came to this but i am happy to see you taking care of yourself
duuuuuude
as soon as we can get em back in covid slows a lot of stuff down
getting a product to retail is a very hard and very expensive thing to do were just starting out and have a long way to go
sucks for you
youre an absolute gem
were looking into it already these things are not simple to do but were trying
holy shit dude
sadly sending to uk brings up its own mess of issues because of the way it charges international shipments i really wish it wasnt so difficult
our coffees should date
believe me i want everyone to be able to enjoy it as well we have to get through some difficult hurdles first before we can full on sprint to the finish line
looking into it this is not my area of expertise so i cant say  the cold brews ship for a lot because theyre the heaviest right now and shipping liquid is very hard especially when it has to go internationally and its still a very small company working from one location
i know but its still really bumming me out to see so much of peoples excitement deflate because of this ill keep working on it
thanks man
agreed i promise you this was not done with ill intent or greed shipping has always been the weakest link in these things and i wish i could make it better with the flick of a switch
i literally just want to get coffee in peoples hands and im sorry that the shipping is becoming such a huge road block
a constantly running store
shopify is showing some bugs on pricing for some items right now that were looking intothe rates on shipping are not made by us and this is literally the best we can do right now obviously i would love really low shipping costs and i will keep fighting for the best rates i can
thank youuuuu
your mouth deserves better
cold brew might be for you
yes
you and me both im an addict fueling my own addiction
hour
brian you are a legend
there will be both whole bean and preground options

demons souls remake will do nicely

the ssd in the ps is a game changer on its own
pm my time the preshow starts

the price and look of the console as well as a bloodborne remaster and a new first party game also hopefully a sequel spiderman
"excited for the ps event tonight give me bloodborne remaster for pc pls

in  hours is insane thank you for all the donations so far lets keep them rolling and hit k soon
and were live baby come hang out and help however you can
stream starts in less than an hour
lt
it starts with liking loving yourself can be much harder but worth striving to as well
learn to like yourself
why havent i been uploading
im sure plenty of people have tried to teach her and change her mind at this point i just dont think she even wants to learn its a shame
"really wish jk rowling would stop tweeting or at least learn something 
anyway trans rights and happy  i hope more people accept you for the beautiful people that you are"
aw man you got a great title all i got was youtuber so boring
probably goal oriented as always but ill likely be live most of the day i wanted to to do it tomorrow but stuff just wasnt ready

"i will be doing a charity stream for  on tuesday 

weve been taking time to get a bunch of organisations up and running on tiltify so that you can donate to a bunch under one goal"
prouda you
i got dem irish bars
thanks for sharing man youre a great man and i have a lot of respect for you
numbers mean nothing if theyre inflated with assholes
amazing
didnt know that thanks for the info
i autofilled the hashtag and accidentally chose the wrong one my mistake sorry
"planning and strategising with tilftify right now on best ways to help trying to cover as many bases as we can with lots of places to funnel support 
will be have more info soon"
i think its a large account with many fans who could be influenced by what it posts so the potential to do some good with it is also large
agreed they should all be sentenced and do jail time the world is watching
this is great news
im not saying you have to like him or excuse what he did he has a powerful voice online and said some really important stuff here you can still hate him if you want but listen to his words beyond that
this is a damn good video i wish more people could look passed their blind hatred and actually listen to whats being said
i never thought id retweet logan paul but this was a good video from him
id say watch logged out in incognito just to make sure good question
to maximise the potential money raised as stated at the start of the video but its important
if you want donate or protest but cant right now heres a wonderful video you can watch to still help out all ad revenue will be donated to associations related to
thats how you do it
i have also donated to this cause
please take time to go here and help
done
also donated
fine just feels weird to record videos right now and slap on a fake smile and pretend that everything in the world is alright
gonna be taking a few days off from videos
will be live on twitch later tonight with these wonderful people raising money and awareness around the george floyd situation
you all doubted me but shes a literal piss baby
"a riot is the language of the unheard  martin luther king jr
these people are not opportunistic or thugs theyre tired of your shitty system and normalised racism how are we still debating this stuff in"
let me know if i can help in any way
i know it was all in good fun thats why i didnt say anything before and didnt want to rain on the parade it would however be nice if you made that distinction in your bio or elsewhere in case people still think youre me later on
im going to step in here because a lot of people seem to think this is my secret account you didnt say anything wrong and im not mad but many people think its me and that can get really messy especially when sensitive topics come up
incredible lol
matched
i have donated to the official memorial fund so far
im trying to find the right words in regards to what happened to george floyd it makes me sick to my stomach i want to act i will be donating to funds that i hope can help i am so sorry george i am so sorry that such racism and hatred still exist in the world

sure but vine also had something go viral and then everyone would just do a parody of it not exactly the same thing but there was still that element of taking others ideas
there are a lot of them for sure part of it being  beforehand theres  just so many more people on the platform that it seems bloated with that stuff theres some genuinely amazing content on it though
big brain
as much as i love vine and quote it i think people often forget what it was like when it actually existed and now just look back at compilations with rose tinted glasses i think tik tok has more tools in place for people to be a lot more creative its getting a lot funnier
the gi in the demo is what impresses me most seeing it bounce around in the cave is nuts
yep yep yep
"bb stretches
ooooohh big stretch
every damn time"

it somehow feels like you found more hours in a day
they fucking should
i havent bought a single turnip in animal crossing
hell yeah waking the fallen by ax and ascendancy by trivium were my prized possessions
yes
positively mental
"i sadly cant provide much advice on it because i usually talk from experience and this has never happened before 
take it slow realise its not the end of the world and even though its crazy well all get back on track eventually hang in there"
you were never cringy yt and its communities were just a lot different back then intesne stan culture was more prominent people have grown with the channel and chilled out since then its great

gotchu fam
correct indeed
they said may the pandemic has changed and delayed a lot of stuff like that though
jackseptikaren
wasnt asked
theyre changing a lot about the game going forward and i kind of wanna wait for that

i was just memeing
lesbian rights
this actually scared me
damn he looks good
god i love this
this came out really well i love it d
the spread of misinformation like that even as jokes can do considerable damage if enough people believe it to be true on the internet then it might as well be real sorry that happened but good thing you called it out
way too far and uncalled for im all for jokes but this kind of stuff is way too far
blink twice if you need help
im going to need a list everyones names and fears that were involved in this call
cos im so incredibly funny right
"me does something stupid
my brain"
congrats man incredibly well deserved

i thought this was about marios brother and i was too dumb to get it lol
lets blast something together
did it get some memes made about it
i respect your moral grandstanding over my potato
hey i know that guy its william osman
one of the coolest things ive ever seen a game do the effort and technology behind it is immense
hell yeah man killing it keep it up proud of you
they love animal crossing and dogs
a real irishman knows a better potato when he sees one which is not this flipped abomination
vibe salad
what if i say please
your loss you wont have sweet potato in your likes now
i really miss the old bfbf playstyle i went back to them recently and its still super fun to get in and just mess around i havent played the series seriously since those games and bf was even the reason i started my channel
"oh shit happy birthday  
hope you can still have fun in the middle of all this"
make this the most liked potato on twitter
happy birthday dude
i have a series from  on it
this is awesome haha
bonjour
hes so cute
incredible
who just shits i go in there to maximise my efforts
oh my god
ya love to see it
streaming with mark bob and wade on twitch
you can be more aggressive than you think
man i gotta get the equipment to try this out
nope none at all it was a recording issue for a couple episodes
im flattered thank you
and i have never ever said it did ive been a huge advocate for seeking professional help for mental health
ive never made money on the pma clothing its all been pumped back into charity stream donations
this is really sad i was pumped for the soundtrack to come out on spotify
i think theres a big difference visually they used special blocks for the trailers to show it off more with different material properties but even base game has a massive increase in lighting and shadow quality
what a lovely lad
whole album sounds tasty dude congrats d
dude it sounds so good great job
changing the game
its been a whole year since i started uploading meme time  happy  and birthday you sweet baby memey dreamers
the first scene where he and metalgarurumon show up to fight venommyotismon got me so hype as a kid
you should never feel belittled or bullied into financially supporting a creator spend more time working on the content because you love doing it and let that do the talking if its good people will support during a pandemic of all times too look after yourself first
take all the time you need man no one prepares you for this sort of stuff and we all handle it differently the love from this end wont stop while you figure things out
streaming minecraft on twitch in about  hours with the irish lads
oof buddy
large toss boy energy
send me your favourite tik toks
a bit other party members are basically brain dead unless you actively control them all the time no jump button stagger gauge is dumb and fights are too reliant on it getting interrupted but using up my mpatb anyway is lame
happy birthday dad
oh boy
you shouldnt be risking a ban by doing something thats in their game even if its an exploit or something they dont like its up to them to patch it out and fix it not punish you for finding it
this seems pretty ridiculous to me
all hail baby sheep god
the anger was all a facade
this pic was taken in the studio recording our ep
got it at one of their concerts
not exactly  but close enough
absolutely
smash like if you up right now late upload gang

im so sorry for your loss jack
time for  all forehead

gotchu fam
thanks man d
this is ultimately why we made the decision not everyone got to see the show so now they can get some of it
we debated a lot on whether we would actually include bits of the show at all since we had so much footage to pick and choose from but i think this style is working really well
omg yes this is so cool
as a thank you for being so patient in waiting for the tour documentary i thought id post a little sneak peak its still coming and shaping up really well i think you guys will really like it
tested positive for seth everman
hah thats gold
this is insane

there are no rules in quarantine anymore
i ran out of time to show this on the stream but its absolutely delightful itll put a big smile on your face
amazing as always
its back up now seems like a bot removed it by accident no idea why but glad that its back up
nope it just tells youvthat it violated guidelines but not which one my yt rep is looking into it now
seems to be just cant think of anything that happened during the stream to even warrant it
"youtube removed my charity stream for violating guidelines absolutely ridiculous
working on getting it back up again"
i stopped and stared at it for like  mins
its sharis birthday lets kick her off the island
having an easy mode like this allows so many more people with accessibility issues to play the game calling it button mashing bullshit is ridiculous
"according to animal crossing today is sharis birthday
im going to give her a special surprise"
the lobby
its still ongoing for the rest of the month

it was crazy
youre a fucking genius and so talented
everything a half life fan could have asked for
excited to see what you come up with ill be helping out with it too
drink everytime you want to kill shari with an axe
half life alyx has one of the greatest endings to a videogame ive ever experienced that was incredible
everyone ends up in hel eventually
this is amazing thanks guys d
awww so cute
its my curse to love amazing games
omg congrats
inside was my favourite game of  im very excited for what they do next
yesssss
"thanks for hanging out on stream it was super fun animal crossing is a great time 
also remember"
an axe will solve all my island problems
my wonderful little boy
your favourite animal crossing villager
toss boy lookin real purdy
an animal crossing stream in  mins ugh fine
dexerto would write an article on a creators bowel movements if they could
oh my god hahaha
pokemon go inside
could always play it on your rift
hel
its been an incredible experience so far
its gonna be a long one games about  hours so itll be a while before its all out up to you
i think you can use the link for quest on pc to play it with it
theres multiple options you can teleportblink around or just move like a regular game whichever makes you more comfortable and less motion sick
the embargo for talking about it wasnt up yet and i jumped the gun accidentally
half life alyx is the greatest vr game ever made cant wait for this series
fascinating video
quest is the best for picking up and playing and the no cables and ability to play anywhere is what vr should be valve index is the best for top tier vr content if you really want the best it has to offer
and even then its a gamble
ill have more info this week hopefully
its a simulation
omg how thats so cool
gonna stream more animal crossing in an hour or so whos ready to jump back into hel
the more the merrier
your animal crossing character is not bad either
working on something big to help out in the covid crisis watch this space because ill be calling on all of you to help if any creators wanna get involved too hit me up more details soon

now thats epic
im always watching
we have some chill chats too to hang out in that are slower its just chaos now cos everyones joinging at once in a few hours itll calm down again
i wouldnt mod them if they werent nice people theres just a massive amount of people to deal with on the server and theyre quite busy theyre doing the best they can

paddy is the ultimate bitlife character pls nerf
wash your fucking hands
its pretty sloppy advice i think a lot of people who say stuff like that have never really had any serious mental health issues plus just being positive all the time is fucking exhausting no one should strive for that

its a business line regular isps were all shit where i live had to go full gamer mode

very the bad internet demon has been slain

start up the labs
scorbunny squad
it really suits you d

supermega more like supermean
deja vu was my ear worm for a good month
apparently
baked beans are great though
this video is amazing
my name is jacksepticeye and im addicted to doing shitty quizzes online
never heard of that before do you think its better than dropbox
amen ive spent some portions of my life holding onto negativity and it just weighs everything down
i never said it was perfect and my time with it actually worked pretty damn well i know others havent but i cant speak for them just what i experienced it had some choppy loading but it didnt have much lag as you can see in the actual video
its such a weird ass movie feels like watching  movies in one
i use bt and my speeds are nothing impressive  down and about  up
"if anything i expected it to be the other way round with my crappy internet ruining the experience i had some buffering issues but as far as latency it was completely fine 
sorry to hear you had to back out of the video due to it"
i honestly had no issues with latency with it i agree with fruit that if it didnt work i wouldnt have uploaded a video on it i was surprised it actually did work as well as it did considering the horror stories i heard hugely varying experiences with it is worrying
"i did show the controller and me hitting buttons to what showed on screen if its not in the video it means robin edited it out 
and stadia does support mouse and keyboard i was using it in the video i dont know what else to tell you i wasnt being sneaky"
hell yeah
amazing
happy birthday hope it was a good one

years of jacksepticeye on youtube

johns awesome

peak gaming condition
aw man really that sucks  really wish we knew more about it still seems like a grey area ripe for abuse

happy birthday ya fecker
i would love that
what is my dream scenario
hell yeah
awesome
spams like
that episode was insane
it looked neat will give it a shot
been meaning to get back to it saw season  and loved it
turns out i was the death stranded all along
im gonna be uploading death stranding daily i hope youtube doesnt ban me for spam
extra shots are the only orders at starbucks
straight black tall americano the purest of the dirty beans
i watched  episodes and stopped i might try again
not this again
oh yeah i need to catch up on the latest season
oh shit you might be right
for the th time its a possibility
binged the whole thing in  days tf do i watch now
i started it yesterday and finished all  seasons already now im lost
meet me on the sky block at dawn
hes by far my favourite character
imma bout to have a hell of a night
ploughing through it right now should i shit or cum first
i binged all of season  yesterday its so good
"barry is an amazing tv show 
bill haders the man"
absolutely
im a boomer
yeah i love scenery and nature so this game has a really nice meditative quality to it in that regard its very cosy
yje idea of the game is to rebuild the country together so the games online feature literally does that with everyone playing the game its global multiplayer basically without actually interacting with other players directly its neat
once you start bringing networks online more and more youll get other players gear to help you which makes it much faster
however there is a social multiplayer system in the game where players can help each other build equipment to speed up the process of deliveries so i wouldnt be surprised if in a months time it takes you half of that time to get to where i am
the first  hours are fucking nuts the atmosphere is so dense and amazing and i wish it kept that pace more but yeah its a very slow burn that you really have to be into to play it has some really interesting ideas though just stuck behind a lot of grind
later on youll start getting much better gear that makes the missions a lot easier and faster its still the same gameplay loop after  hours but the story really starts to kick in more and more as you go
"i dont think it meets the hype its a very barebones game at times and if you dont like fetch quests youll hate this game you really have to be invested in the world and the story its a very meditative game though
i like it personally but its a weird game to explain haha"
promise d
its crazy how long it takes for death stranding to really get going im like  hours into it now and the pace of the game really picks up from there but i imagine a lot of people wont even get to that point i really like the game though but i understand if many dont
happy birthday man hope its a good one d keep killin it
no u
hahaha
maybe i can start playing again now haha
this just kicked my ass
im godai
this is beautiful
siiiiick
it seems super long yeah im about  hours in so far
"yall ready to get freaky with norman reedus and his amazing fetus
death stranding starts now"
best tweet
luigis fuckin stacked
aw congrats d
instructions unclear broke my nose
i agree shit sucks all of these potential hurdles even kill my motivation and creativity some days
if luigi can find a boo then so can you
"the problem is its a misfire of the id matching system when taking on a new channel its not purposefully being done
i agree its super stressful and creators affected shouldnt have to manually dispute each one the network should be aware and manually remove the claims"
god of war space dlc
im ready papa geoff
this sadly happened when i switched networks a while back too it matched cutscenes from games as my content in telltale games id say dispute them and it should get fixed annoying but solvable
thanks hanna glad you like it d

green cos jacksepticeye is your favourite youtuber
as someone whos gone through their fair share of mental battles of hating myself and life  i can assure you that better days lie ahead and are absolutely worth the struggle theres no perfect solution for everyone but i wish you the best on your journey you got this
"its  so its a good time to remind you to look after yourself mentally youre the one who has to spend the most amount of time with yourself it doesnt have to be a bad time 
whatever youre going through or will go through it doesnt last forever"
dude im losing my mind
exclusively for you next week
"had the worst year of my life back in  i feel you
hang in there keep up that fight and keep pushing forward and youll make it to calmer waters man"
no fuckin way
i think all of this just reinforces what a terrific idea cuphead really was it would be a shame if they didnt acknowledge that its clearly emulating that success trying to ride coat tails doesnt look good if you dont add anything different or pay homage
damn this is unexpected
dude no way this is so amazing
"kttbulle this way yes
so many epic kttbulle"

"youre here which means you already know what you want 
 mcdonalds probably"
people can shit on the dab all they want but we all know it screams big gamer energy
i was impressed by the visuals but felt like the whole thing lacked soul it was almost too realistic in animal behaviour juxtaposed against talking and singing not awful though
these old gamer bones just arent the same anymore
mood

tiredness is a baseball bat and jet lag is beating me to death with it right now

let toad get his victory
all he did was yell at things this season his character got assassinated
one day at a time and reasonable reachable goals progress is progress
aw man that sucks im so sorry rip little buddy
whats alarming is it doesnt seem like theyve learned a whole lot from pogo its in a similar beginning spot when it really shouldnt be
teank you
whoa thats so cool
always a bad sign also not taking any responsibility for any issues that arose previously i always respect someone more if they can own up to some shit
they have great ideas but awful execution pokemon go also lost everyone almost immediately for terrible design decisions and wiz seems to be doing the same thing their games never seem to go beyond surface level addiction really
hell yeah geddit
thats now my goal yes
agreed i mean if youre gonna remake something its cool to take risks and try different things it would never live up to the animated movie so well see where it goes
happy for you dude
me too d im a big fan of the original
proud of you papi
hes not a dragon anymore theyre making him a phoenix to be more historically accurate also apparently no music in the movie either or very little
isnt he the bird in the trailer im curious to see what they change and modernise it
no thats
i found one of my favourite artists on reddit when they drew some really cool bloodborne inspired art its been my phone background since then you can imagine how giddy i was when they said they were a fan and wanted to work on something together i love this piece
congrats you guys d so happy for you
that was amazing haha
you got this
this is wild
what if my problem is not looking like seth everman
i didnt really enjoy season  that much felt a little all over the place id say s is still worth it but it might not fox any of the issues you have
glad youre having fun
well then
its waaaddeee
hah
how you gonna say that when season  exists
"you die and the latest pic on your camera roll is what defines your legacy what is it
heres mine"
global warming suddenly backs off and says my bad
holy crap this is amazing
thats awesome d congrats
you might lose said profit from the ailments people will get and the legal issues you would face as a result
fully commit dad bod and all
at least he has the peter tingle now
my boy
agreeeeed i need that buddy show pronto throw erica and robin there too
that poor boy just wants to imagination and fuck shit up let him imagine
it does definitely nail that the shots and lighting are so good this season
finished season  as soon as it came out incredible show that i wish more people knew about
yep its not bad its just not gripping me as much anymore like you said needs to shake things up a bit
i still like it more than   being the beat overall personally
"shes great liked her a lot her and erica stole the show 
i feel like this season is just sort of too much of the same so i wasnt as invested some nice relationship moments though"
finished stranger things  i liked it some really cool moments in it its starting to feel a little too samey though the plot and characters feel like theyre not evolving or progressing as much as they should be and learning monster visuals were dope
legendary
call lassie
arent most americans irish
i left miller out

weird to think that every american was born today the same day we beat the aliens

so many sorrys
hacks
im about to detain this mans whole career
that little c is freaking me out
me repeating jokes thats silly
and the cumulative world goes deaf all at once
weird that shes  years old
that would be ridiculous
"weird to think that every canadian was born on the same day
happy"
this looks delightful
marios a monster
smh my head
fuck that im gonna swear up a storm
love it
"another fantastic game by  
be warned though it gets really serious and delves into some really dark topics"
sorry i missed it but happy birthday you deserve all the love in the world

shes got you there
what a rollercoaster
want me to come over and tuck you in
thats so cool
this is gold haha

cuties

the people who run the merch store actually did it this time
"june charity stream is happening tomorrow in celebration of pride month we are partnering with the trevor project 
we will be trying to raise  and selling an exclusive pin and some pma pride clothing all of which is going towards the charity"
solid plan looking forward to wholesome content
"announce gay  stay away
wtf twitter"
where are the squirrels
ill know to ignore your opinions from now on
otacon
exactly what my thought process was too i think people are scared that it will become a pay to watch platform which is silly will completely depend on how streamers use it
it was a forfeit tweet written by a friend as a joke not me
exactly gives paying subs something extra as long as streamers dont ignore everyone else too then its fine
yeah i dont get the uproar over an optional feature sure some streamers will abuse it but not all of them more options arent a bad thing
fully livestreamed too
i really want to try the food you guys make can i be a food guinea pig
need some twang in my life pronto
how many for a duck face reveal
c here yesterday which for brighton is unheard of
european weather right now
wanna be my donkey
yall really made this my most popular tweet ever huh

hey now
sorry to hear youre going through that it sucks that theres not much to do against them online reporting here on twitter does basically nothing and they make dozens of accounts when you block
im glad you got the roles you did because theyve had a huge impact on my life voice actors are some of the most humble people ive ever met too
this is an everyday mood
tall sean x
happy birthday man hope you have a wonderful day
same great bearded taste with  sugar
good for you being super tall for
this is a shop full of photos
i wouldnt lie on twitter
in in the netherlands though where everything is taller by default
lies on the internet
it actually says shaun my name is a fuckin wild ride
they got my name wrong but at least they got my height right
huge congrats fellow barbarian man killing it
i assure you hes even lovelier than youre imagining
i think its because youre genuine and dont need to prove yourself to anyone you have a very strong passion for what you do and dont need giant events and spectacle to keep goinga lot of this celeb culture is people flexing on each other and validating themselves through it
congrats guys
what a journey
"just showing my support 
im always open for a good bang"
go for it have fun and kick some ass
killin the game
exactly you can basically do whatever you want with it
adobe premiere

creating youtube videos is so much fun its dumb and its completely over the top at times some viewers of youtube content take it all way too damn seriously though sometimes embrace stupid shit and have fun along the ride stop putting limitations and expectations on it
yep part of the reason undertale is so amazing is because it fully takes advantage of the video game medium characters and story are all great and could work but the meat of the game is the decisions and consequences of those decisions that can only happen interactively
dont apologise at all haha you didnt do anything wrong  im just clarifying for people since so many had been asking me about it
its completely fake
yes
love this art style
already off to an amazing start

going live now with  to talk about game of thrones
bingo im fine with where almost everyone ended up but it didnt feel like half of it was earned they threw out character details to service the end goal which got was always good at avoiding
good to hear buddy
top  reasons season  sucks no  will make you shit your pants
its the previous streams title
you a real one
gonna be streaming on twitch in about  hours with robin to talk about game of thrones in depth full spoilers for the entire show
i never stopped
im referring to season  being rushed not the whole show
i will always love you dude
game of thrones feels like the showrunners knew where they wanted the characters to end up but had no idea how to get them there this season it felt incredibly rushed and ham fisted what a waste of amazing lore and world building
bet theyve never even watched an  episode
hell orchestrate his way into peoples hearts
thank you so much for the tickets such a cool experience really happy we got to go
went to see an orchestra play final fantasy music live tonight something ive always wanted to do it was exceptional
uploading twice a day constantly took a huge mental toll
didnt want open headphones anymore
its not trying to be an incredibly realistic sound part of the point is because it sounds shit
elgato cam link me into capture card and then obs
absolute mad lad
felix says that but he gets hyper aggressive when he starts losing lol
"stories untold is free on the epic store right now its a fantastic game that i think more people should know about and play

not on my dead shamrocks
you still think im irish right bob
its not over yet snake
more and more i realise sam and i are the same person
for me high intensity circuit training helps a lot to get your endurance up as an alternative to just keep running until you get better after doing that for a while your body can take on more and your breathing capacity gets better so running is much easier
"gets in uber

driver hows your day
me pretty good
driver oh youre american

jumps out of moving vehicle"
this person truths
so youve had  mins
sorry for truth bomb
average mediocrity
if youre looking for top tier high quality mediocrity youve come to the right place
its dlc
so glad it got added
always listen to your body and try to do what it needs hope things settle back down for you soon
thats awesome man congrats d keep killin it
this ones even better
happy birthday
seasons  are fantastic you should still watch it
i dont mind some of the events happening in general i just dislike how theyre getting the characters to those points its really sloppy and rushed to get to the point
its pretty obvious she has some darkness in her building up over the seasons but the way they got to that point feels like a complete mess
this season of game of thrones will go down as one of the biggest fuckups in tv history what a waste
thank you for not holding out on us papa john
happy birthday to all the moms out there crazy that all moms were born on the same day
this is total bullshit hope you get it sorted

marios the ultimate memelord
and ive been saying stuff like this from the very beginning of my channel
is that big krabus
ive said worse
i love the high res version of this meme its so off putting haha
youve seen worse
when you eatin ass but mom says the pizza rolls are ready
newest drivers have horrid issues for me on a lot of games on rtx cards im still rocking  drivers because of it
id rather be this old man than in my early twenties again that shit sucked
chocolate milk is fine if youre  years old
seems to be a hdmi issue for a lot of people playing on my displayport monitors is buttery smooth but switch to hdmi ones and its ass
thats not how you spell the same great coke taste but zero sugar now with a hint of added vanilla
thank you so much for yet another very successful charity stream so many more people will now have access to fresh clean drinking water because of your very generous donations and support
cant wait to see your style and this game together
poster when
gamers unite
it came out so bloody good thanks for letting me be a part of it
the stream isnt even live yet and people have already given two separate  donations you guys are the best
gonna stream some sekiro and never die once
hope everythings ok hang in there
today kicks off the charity drives worldwide for world water day reminder that i will be streaming tomorrow on my channel raising k for charity water as well lets knock it out of the park
had this happen so often when i lived at my old place always made me incredibly uncomfortable
i dont see the words zero or vanilla anywhere
my ass will be the cleanest its ever been
thats very sweet of you dude d thank you
and i could not be more grateful for all the work you guys put into it made a wonderful experience even more special
yeah not me lol
yeah this is exactly what i wanted to avoid it ends up becoming the just choose happiness approach which has never been the point or intention of pma it has always been an empowering mantra to help go further not a solution the the issue
i like this idea wording will need to be important though
a year damn
i will
i wasnt trying to attck anyone the reason i responded to becs was mainly because she was saying what i already thought so i was using it as a way of clarifying my thoughts to everyone else who wanted to know where i stood apologies if it sounded rude
keep the ideas coming if you guys have them
"this is a fantastic idea and journals were something we drew up designs for a while back ill look into it
might be hard to get done for thos saturdays stream but can definitely have for the next one"
i also wasnt trying to call you out or shut you down its something that was being discussed a lot your post seemed like a good jumping off point sorry if people are giving you shit
thats fair  same reason id never say my content actually cures depression these things take a lot of work to overcome
if people think its the long term solution to mental illness then they havent been listening to what ive actually said about it or even my reasoning for it in the first place
i have never once said that pma is a solution to deep rooted mental health issues its a positive reaffirmation mantra to keep trying your best when things get grim it losing meaning to some hopefully means that theyre doing better mentally now
this is wonderful
oh shit gotta catch some of these shows
oh hell yeah
you all ready for more real proud dad action james knocks it out of the park
ill play the dlc when it comes out
this is awesome news

"the power of the internet is strong when it comes to doing good

dont let this taint your view of a good country this was an act of horror by one sickening individual trying to cause division and anger he does not represent the people there
it has a bigger impact than you might think youre a good man
thanks for this link made a contribution
some people just want to do damage and cause as much carnage as they can in the world horrified to hear what happened in new zealand my thoughts and love are with those affected today
so sorry to see your name be attached to something so horrific
rd
wonderfully d
sicko mode
hon the bois
tool in
absolutely have some of my fondest memories on that tour
the grumpiest
i would definitely follow you into battle
excited for it
thats pretty neat
im calling my mom
this tweet
im already a pirate
seems like i need to remedy this lack of overalls
ive had them for  years lol
i got silicone ones because the metal doesnt agree with my skin so they look bigger since theyre so thin
happy birthday d
rubbing the tears of bad gamers into my pores
still mm just less edge on them so they look bigger
terrifying
you met boston dynamics sn model
your dad
jesus
we need tseries subs and pewdiepies subs to drop in a round in apex so we can show them how real gamers do it
plus ultra
the zowie stuff is really damn good
this person does not exist
see a doctor first for any sort of back pain before you have someone pushing and pressing very hard around there they could do more damage otherwise
she did feel a little inconsistent i chalked it up to bad scriptdirecting
yeah he was great that character actually had some depth and proper motivation
its the fucking best
"drone here if ya need it 
hopefully a fast recovery dude"
i really really couldnt lol
sure im just saying my opinion on it you might love it so why not give it a try
i can agree with this her character just didnt click with me felt like she didnt have her own identity and was an amalgamation of other mcu characters we met before
id still say go see it for yourself and if you like it then thats great i love the marvel movie franchise but this one missed the marl for me had lots of potential
"its the problem that occurs with a character this powerful you have to restrain her somehow and amnesia was the best they could do it seems 
i agree that the sudden leap sort of undercut it all"
plenty of people
is terrific in everything else but didnt do it for me in this she didnt feel likeable at all
its pretty damn crazy how seamless that was for sure
haha yeah thats fair its not as bad as those
and an incredibly predictable and sloppy plot too
i am all for equality and empowerment but as a movie on its own merits its poorly written and paced
gladly
there is no other explanation
thats not a cat thats a flerken
really wanted to like captain marvel but it was so boring and bland to me  sam jackson and the cat were the only things i really liked
this is great haha
my people suffered for many years at the hands of these traps how dare you insult my potato people like this
wonder how many ws jesus had
"everyone else let us pray
gamers let us play"
it matters far less these days too years ago consistency and frequency were way more important
oh my god congrats you guys
well you did lay down some seriously vicious insults in that  track
"if youre going to pax east at the end of this month my schedule is as follows 

panel on friday th march at pm

this has to be a mockup it looks like an iron maiden for hands

on my way to the ranch

the plan is set in motion
haha really not like i played well either p all good
sonic design bad
thats hot
yaaaahhh

great video
what the fuck
she also birthed you knowing youd die one day you really trust her
and yet somehow i still keep winning in this scenario just like apex how many wins do you have
have you seen a doctor
were all dying simon
as long as its the same great coke taste but zero sugar then its ok unless its orange then fuck everyone
the people want answers
good thing twitter has a block button
a true believer
thats ok i cant get a sponsorship
i really shouldnt cherry pick my coke
i get my rush from life and sweet ws in video games
but its disgusting so thats a thing
oh boy howdy have i
why would you say something so brave yet so wrong
some of you know im not sponsored by coke and it shows
sellout till the end
so epic
this is so sad  like   spon
how many more times am i going to have to tell you that its the same great coke taste but zero sugar now with a hint of added vanilla
its an error for missing c redistributables i had the same issue had to uninstall all of them in control panel and restart the download

curl your tongue so you can lick your own nose easier
hoo boy i know what im watching tonight
pma baby
im glad to hear youre doing better d
exactly routine can be good for time management but the same routine for too long will kill the fun and love for something
im happier than ive ever been and it sucks to see some people try to force me back into a box because theyre uncomfortable with something being different
ive been doing this gig for a long time now and im not nearly the same person i was  years ago or when i started im trying to keep things fresh and fun for myself because repetition and boredom are the killers of creativity change is scary but not always bad
so have as much fun as you can
his new stuff is killer
this is great d thank you
your use of colour is alway super pleasing
no i dont sweat so when i get warm i overheat quickly and get red splotchy patches on my skin
killin it
im not upset about it
world touring superstar of the highly praised jacksepticeye how did we get here liveshow comedy world tour and good friend of ryan reynolds
fuck yeah all them good boys together
they tasted like troubled childhood and daddy issues delicious
im moist
what a little bitch
who is that small child on the right
its not misleading the title directly relates to the content of the video
do you want high quality top tier not sponsored by coke apex action of course you do
a true content influencer never stops the grind
give me a platform to resurrect myself
jacksepticeye is dead
nice dude
be careful what you say
the more people who tell me to shave my beard the longer and stronger it gets
the plot thickens
rumour has it jim cameron also has the sweat of leo and kate from that scene in a small vial that he dips his pen into when writing new scripts
we both looked at each other smirked and nodded

shit cos its really cool
"charity stream is starting in  hours not only do we have a cool new pin but ill also be announcing some super cool secret new merch items too

you did the thing
ill post more political stuff instead so it blends in with the rest of google
guy next to me at a urinal just looked down at his penis and said ello mate before he started peeing
youre like the kid who wasnt invited to the party but came anyway and shat in the pool just to get a reaction
seriously
glad you like it d
buy  just in case
will you be in rewind this year
a few weeks theyre made to order so they dont start production until we have the final number of sales in as we cant stock inventory of a limited item
pin designed by our very own and very talented  im so happy with the way it turned out
next charity stream is going to be on sunday th raising money for the gamers outreach foundation on my youtube channel here is the design for the exclusive pin for this month too d

dont forget to take some time for yourself today breathe turn your brain off for a bit and let the world melt away
wish more people would shine a light on all the good they can do with their influence rather than tearing each other down to build their own selfbrand up
absolutely people attach themselves to their channels in a personal way so when things go wrong they blame and devalue themselves not to mention the effect trying to be the most popular and get trending has on peoples personalities and how they view others
dude this is so sweet of you to say d im flattered that you even watched them thank you so much incredible game great job
congrats you guys d so happy for you youll make a great dad

im the one who photoshopped this so that makes sense lol
at this time of year at this time of day in this part of the country localised entirely within in your kitchen
normally its an easy fix by adding our own music but it clashes with spoken dialogue in the game
a joke lol
if you ever see me on the street and i look angry im probably just thinking about my relationship with my father
hes nailing the character
never apologise for having a bad day were fortunate in this line of work that we are our own bosses so dont be so hard on yourself come back strong when you have that mojo flowing through you again

darn tootin

sorry i went to the salty sea side opposite you d
im on the wrong side
im on the america side of the world right now everything smells like bacon
hoping the best for you you dont deserve such rotten luck get better soon
maybe if you ever went outside youd develop an actual immune system and not the baby one you have
hold your arms out and pretend youre flying
"airports have to be one of the unhappiest places on earth everyone always looks so miserable 
i dont know why cos im eating sushi there right now and its pretty dope"
amazing
truly blessed with jig legs and a heart for dance
all i need is some adidas in there and it would be complete
oi
that was my determination leaking through
that guy was definitely gonna fuck your bitch for sure
it was really damn fun cant wait to see what you cook up next
"you should have come over o
i was fanboying over simon pegg tbh"
pizza guy sorry thought you were crying my mistake
happy birthday
every single time
pizza guy oh wait you shook my hand properly cant be pewdiepie my bad
you mean make felix cringe with his biggest phobia
my grave
"me hey hows it goin
pizza guy good you
me you uh good yeah"
i guess each person will react differently to it
i mean in the context of why theyre there it makes sense its supposed to be absolutely littered with them
the movie is exactly as advertised a really fun piece of eye candy and references and i had a blast
also jj abrams walked by me as we left so im basically gonna be in the next star wars now
"ready player one was really fun all the videogamey references and hidden stuff had me geeking out a bit so im biased book lovers might not like some parts of it though 
the sound design was so good felt every thump and crunch"
super nice meeting you too dude
congratulations d
about to see ready player one at the london premiere
great interview dude keep up the good work and positivity
im trying anyway haha thanks man
"its for whenever we have our boxing match 
thanks man"
its gonna be great you guys good luck with it d
guess well have to settle this in the ring rock em sock em robot battle to the death no rules backspins are wild and i get to be blue
just tried to make sure i took the time for it regardless of whatever else i was doing most of the challenge came from eating right  of of the results was from the diet it took a lot of effort to keep it up
aw thanks suz
thanks d definitely feels nice to be somewhat in shape again
dont mirror shame me
hope you had a grand auld sup a tae with that
this is the winner
"still gonna keep it up as much as i can this year  
small steps can lead to big changes"
believe me you have no idea how many times ive almost broken down in front of krispy kreme
literally blocked all of them lol so pathetic
myfitnesspal is condescending anyway p
anytime bby
beer is definitely a strong temptress
still have a long way to go myself but you can do it man its hard to find the time and energy for it regularly but it pays off
rebranding
thanks man d
anything is possible
it took a lot of effort to keep it up and do it every day dedicating time to it which i didnt have haha never too late dude
right back at ya  trust me guys shes gotten super buff too
that clock hasnt been accurate for a long time lol
at the start of the year i was the heaviest i had ever been i made it a goal to workout everyday before i went on tour to try get back in shape and have the energy for it i am extremely proud of the results ive achieved lost kg about lbs
today is an all day recording kind of day
"thats so awesome haha 
seriously though we need to meet hopefully our paths cross at some point this year"
afraid you might sound dumb on paddys day i will help you become fully irish
but were twins
not in my heart
lol
happy st patricks day go out on the lash and have a few scoops but dont be a gobshite and get into ructions youll only get a baytin then
this was fantastic such a clever idea
trying to watch anime and do something else at the same time but cant cos i have to constantly keep up with the subtitles
my brain couldnt keep up lol
now that ive actually lived away from home for a while recording paddys day videos makes me miss it a lot so many weird quirky things irish people say and do
its basically a public service at this point
granny tried to save the day
sure when im scuttered i wont even be able to tell which end of me arse is up
dont want anyone gettin baytins
"remember as we go into irish day tomorrow
its paddys day not pattys day"
hey siri
aw man dont feel too bad  its all good at least you were honest and apologised appreciate it dude
i loved this thank you very much for all the kind words too
one of us
this is a feature being added to most big channels later this year im just in the beta for it it has nothing got to do with me wanting more money it was just enabled on my channel earlier than others when did i specifically tell people to sponsor me
the fuuuuuuuuck
holy shit thats really cool we were just talking about it too lol
feeling very delightfully ruined
man even your replies are copied is anything you post original content anymore
biggest stream ever on a solo creators channel and maybe all of twitch the gamer streamer world normally doesnt get taken this seriously its insane exposure and credibility for gaming and streamers everywhere
hotline bling drake
people apparently lol
im watching history sleep can wait
history is being made on twitch right now with drake playing fortnite with ninja absolutely nuts what a crazy day for gaming
tour
dude no way
sad to hear that stephen hawking has passed away one of the greatest minds to have ever graced the earth rip
such a bizarre move but at least now i get to watch it over and over without paying premium p
"such a cool premise the ending really fucks with you haha
also it was bloody gorgeous"
watched annihilation on netflix and its one of my favourite scifi movies that ive seen in a long time so good
"its a lot like a patreon based on how it works you create the perks people get 
its gonna be great for less frequent uploaders and smaller channels"
still green on the inside
no worries d
what had her so excited lol
awesome as long as youre happy with it d
honestly you dont have to i dont want anyone to feel pressured into it
always
im not posting these things as some sort of sly self promotion thats not how i do things i just like cool new features
its basically just a paid subscription it has nothing got to do with ad frequency
exactly like twitchs its a monthly thing you can pay to help out creators if you want to really good for smaller channels who cant make it through adsense alone also a secondary source of income
no it hasnt
thats why i tell people to punch it
self promotion is not my style im just excited about new features
ill even bring you scout cookies
it directly supports channels as a source of income outside of ad revenue yt will be pushing out sponsorships to a lot more channels this year
this is literally a beta for select channels right now it cant be late if its not even fully implemented lol
its been on desktop for a while but on the app its new i think
sponsoring is not just for livestreams now anymore this sits directly on the channel next to the subscribe option
"well apparently im late to the darknight mode thing fine
then how about this brand new shiny sponsor button on the channel"
ooooooh youtube dark mode
agreed
oh shit i forgot thats out on netflix gon watch that tonight yo
whats one meme you legitimately didnt like or rolled your eyes at everytime you sawheard it
its  again my time machine worked
its the worst
incredible
this is the greatest and best tweet in the world tribute
no thats likely going to be after halloween
more handsome too
recently had this pain
ill be around a bunch more throughout the year d
ultra instinct champion
did you see those guns i dont want to go to prison for murder
summer most likely
to do a live show tour one needs to train like a champion and be the best they can possibly be
the white house make some sick montages
"rubs theorist chin
interesting"
america was created by the government to sell candy hearts during valentines day to fund the flat earthers
i mean its pretty damn big lol
thats a good tweet lol
proof my time machine still works
its a super old invention that doesnt really make sense anymore but it gives me daylight until close to pm in the summer so im good with it p
then why does mine keep running out
we change later this month
not all places are america
reminder since daylight savings kicked in for some of you today videos might appear to be late because of your time change
"just take a hedge clippers reach around and use it backwards
simple"
happy mothers day to all the badass moms out there kicking ass on a daily basis
congrats man streams have kept me very entertained lately onwards and upwards dude
that lighthouse launch sequence is fucking marvelous
aesthetic
sick
happy birthday mia d hope you have a day of wonderful dunks on videogame nerds
happy birthday doc have a good one man
yep just a lot to handle behind the scenes and i dont want it to stress me out too much before hitting the road for tour
well i could have told you that
only going to be one upload on the channel today trying to take things a little easier with a lot of other stuff going on lately
i can mocap easily if needed
what happens at am on stream
matthew matosis ruined it for me lol
signing not singing lol

i see how it is
happy birthday d hope its a good one
im sure when you hit  itll kick right in
this is why im glad i grew facial hair lol i was forever stuck in teen face mode

happy  to all the women out there making the world a better place including those close to me and dear to my heart
lookin damn fine
where you hiding the death note
i could be in the tub that jonny cruz stewed in
yes
streams are always a solid place for them to still work
its very sad this is why so many channels have moved away from them more and more
i would do silent hill  in a heartbeat if i didnt already know that it would be a dead on arrival series youtube doesnt really push long form series anymore sadly
should be itll probably be one every other day and hopefully some vlogs on the road too but i cant promise anything
ill be heading out on tour soon so content will slow way down during that period anyway dont really wanna take a break before that happens
problem is skits take far more planning and time to produce and cant be done as often i would love to do more but it would take all day just for a simple thing
as much as i love playing and recording games sometimes its so hard to find goodentertaining stuff to record it can burn you out and leave you feeling creatively spent
dont fuck it up
thats lovely congrats you guys
ill try
those moments still happened though and the interaction itself to me means more than having a record of it we will all have more interactions again and again in the future too but i know how much that must suck so im sorry for that
i know im very sorry for that it wasnt my intention to hurt or upset people by doing it the only way i could delete them was mass deleting a time period of tweets instead of getting to pick and choose didnt realise it would delete all replies too
that was a different tour  i will likely hit london later in the year
ill likely get closer to there later in the year
gifts will be handed at the merch booth and i will get them after
ill get you season tickets court side
yeah i went back and deleted a lot of old tweets because my account was super bloated i had k tweets and wanted things to feel fresh and new for this year
"hey you did you know that im going on tour in just over  weeks well now you do thats so little time
get your tickets at"
lateralus was the first i listened to so im biased p
going to be firing up the bonus episode of life is strange in about  minutes

shape of water was really good the aesthetic and soundtrack were incredible shame some people in the crowd got bored and decided to ruin it for everyone else by yelling  didnt stop me from having a good time though
genius
my own brain betrays me
im sure my natural charm and charisma could have won him over anyway
i asked ryan if he knew his and he said of course this movie is important so i got terrified of letting him down and pretended nothing was wrong
i got to smell him so yes
a character that doesnt even exist in real life named ash but apparently it was a big deal
apparently not in dream land
happy birthday
had a dream that i got to be in deadpool  but when i pulled up to set with ryan he knew all his lines and i knew none of mine it went from dream to nightmare real fast
finally another one of my people everyone else always dies from jet lag and im sitting there like whats next
yep winter is like perpetual night time over here
congrats d

the  launch from spacex today is one of the coolest things ive ever seen absolutely mind blowing
"on rotten tomatoes so far though
super pumped to see it too"
shadow of the colossus
hey  can i just try on the spidey suit just once i promise im clean and smell great
its a tough road stick at it your feet harden knees strengthen and hair shines when you master it
will you shout me out ill mention you in my next lets play videogame commentary video
watch billy elliot  times in a row
can i commission you for channel banner
good shout saved d
i created one for other people not myself
might need a time machine to accomplish all the things i wanna do this year so if you have one could you let me borrow it
you literally broke twitch with the comeback
thats so good hahaha
you could still enjoy it d dont just take my word for it
agreed it either needed a lot more of it or none of it at all felt shoe horned in
i need this dog
thats the dream i want to see more of the other worlds
thats not what the tweet was implying
this its not relevant to the overall arc of the story but its an incredible movie
what can i say i know what i like and im opinionated about games and movies lol
theres  haha the original  cloverfield lane and this new one the cloverfield paradox
it didnt come out in cinema its on netflix immediately
i think it had its moments that was definitely one of them and having chris o dowd in anything is a plus i just think the whole package was lacking especially as the third movie in a franchise that was great so far
happy birthday baby boy hope you have a fantastic time miss you and hope to see you again soon this year
i wouldnt say so it ties into the first one more
same its just too generic borrows too much from other movies and throws cloverfield stuff in unnecessarily has its moments but overall not very memorable would like to hear your thoughts if you watch it
id always suggest watching stuff for yourself though and making up your own mind these are just my opinions on it
incredible
it felt like generic sci fi space movie to me didnt need to be attached to cloverfield at all
definitely
first  were i think
the second one is amazing the acting and paranoia and everything creates such a wonderful tense atmosphere
i mean id always recommend watching stuff yourself anyway to make up your own opinions
hard to say cos theyre very different but probably the original cos i love monster movies
black mirrors amazing
watched the new cloverfield this morning not a good movie i love the previous  but this new one was completely forgettable felt like a black mirror episode more than anything
agreed
my skin is stain free
i keep walking around my house hoping  pops out of some random corner to tell me im in a tide ad
so pumped for more cloverfield and westworld
superbowl
gonna have to take a look at this superb owl that everyones talking about today
the new jumanji looked god awful when i saw the trailers but the movie itself was actually pretty good fun
that was tasty im so out of practice with overwatch haha havent played in months
we dont know their ages but yes its always assumed theyre fairly young that being said old wander had this strong look of determination and will on his face new wander looks like hes made of clay at times its super distracting
good game to spend  hours of your life in
the character models are my only big gripe with the remake artistic choices here and there are subjective but his face is objectively far worse in the remake he looks like a child
hot damn me and my boy bill
lookin good my dude
god damn that looks good
youre in for a hell of a ride man i envy you
this tweet made my eyes vomit
do i look like a bitch
yes hes my uncle
just like the taste this tweet left in my mouth

delicious shit
my tongue is made of lead so we good
youre gross
you must be stronger willed
but michael scott loves paper
wondering the same thing
yum
i dont need no help
rookie
and take away that sweet sexy waxy taste not on my watch

these guys helped craft my show and helped organise the whole tour itself they do great stuff and i couldnt be happier to work with them
i remember saying something about drinking aloe in a video and people said it wasnt something you could drink week later i was addicted to an aloe drink in a local store lol why do people not realise its a thing
yeah sad i couldnt make it but i gope the launch goes super smoothly for you all d
oh shit excited d
yep should be basically the exact same thing
if you can afford it and can run it then go for it d
yet to be determined p a lot of my favourite games ever made have strong nostalgia subnautica isnt old enough for that factor yet
yes it does its only like  i think
of course great game to just explore and spend your time in totally worth it i think
absolutely
all games make me happy but subnautica has a special place in my heart
"thats just a small snippet of their kindness and gratitude theyre constantly telling me how much they love my series and how much ive helped haha too many compliments
i was supposed to be in america with them today for the launch but sadly couldnt"
im very curious to see how the end game stuff happens d
hey everyone shes texting in college im telling
dude you should stick with it shit gets really crazy later on in that game with a good few surprises
"subnautica fully comes out today i could not recommend that game more its been such a huge part of the channel and the devs are also the biggest sweethearts 
im very envious of those who get to experience it for the first time"
so good d
aw hell yeah
such nice quality
so what youre saying is that i can now breathe in water
when you somehow swallow your own saliva wrong and almost choke to death for  minutes my own body out here trying to kill me
i envy you first time through it is a crazy experience
the kids at the end got me
my favourite game of all time is back the shadow of the colossus ps remake is finally here

i have never once used the mic on the vive so i couldnt say
very rarely my room isnt huge and the receiver is pretty close by so i dont know if that plays a factor every now and then the screen will flicker or something but nothing major
i cant go back to the wired version anymore the freedom the tpcast gives is too cool
but they tweeted like  mins after i asked them d
next up the wireless kit

there is no way back from this hole
disgusting
all ive done for the last hour is watch videos of bts i wish i was a kpop i want to be able to dance too
its like a fucking sitcom at this point
love this
i saw the video earlier in the day recommended to me but thought it was clickbait that was until i saw  tweet about it in my timeline and finally went to check for myself i think felix posted about it at almost the same time too
to be expected considering how theyve replied to many other topics in the past lets see if any action is taken to really show where they lie on the issue
a fine resume of quality character traits hes built
what if one of the kids stumbled upon the body he says as he shows millions of impressionable kids on his channel then making jokes about it while still next to the guy i cant man
scary that so many kids saw this before it was even made a big deal
i was actually shocked that more people werent talking about it
feel like thats not even serious enough
i mean most of his audience are kids who are naive which makes it all so much worse
dont know how anyone could stand with him on this
btw not joking or exaggerating at all do not seek out the video if youre at all sensitive to that stuff its very real
yea and all he does is blur the face but records super up close so messed up
wish i was joking
saw the title of the vlog before and thought it was clickbait but he actually did that that is the most fucked up thing ive seen someone do on youtube there is absolutely no defending that wrong on so many levels
beware the malicious gamer
oh shit bazinga
get the fuck up and rock the day
door screams in top of the morning to ya laddies
still yet to sneeze think its gonna be a good one though
oh dang at least my roblox rep is still squeaky clean
thank you d take care of yourself too

still working out and im killing it
i demand fives that are so high
its what i do baby
solid advice
gotta get into its house first
welcome d thanks for taking part hope youre enjoying yourself
never
ah i think you meant somebody

ill make you a life size body pillow haha
you too buddy
i am definitely going to try anyway  heres to lots of love and laughs for everyone
i love you guys and i am extremely grateful for you all sticking with me through thick and thin heres to an insane  and beyond
point is your mental health shouldnt be ignored or feared its what everything you have and love stems from and if you let it get out of hand then it can rule your life self care is a big part of my  resolution and it should be yours too
mainly yeah even though its still not the full picture but youll get a sense for it
i am however leaving  incredibly optimistic and ready to take on the next year full force and make it one of the best years of my life ive done some soul searching and now have a much clearer head than i did at the start of the year
i have some negative emotions towards  despite it giving me some of the coolest experiences ive ever had mainly because it took a huge toll on my mental health and without taking care of myself it got out of hand
but can it do this
due
remember jacksepticeye this is him now feel old yet

going live on youtube felt like hanging out and chatting d
fucking incredible
both videos uploaded at the same time i uh um meant to do that merry christmas
had this happen with human fall flat with robin fucking sucks dude sorry to hear especially for a game like that
but ive heard the dark side is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural
im not taste blind though
next time i come over you will need to show me the ways
dont tell it what it cant be
sweet sexy tasty lies
tell that to my taste buds
bye dont need dirty not white chocolate lovers
i dont normally like to get political on here but white chocolate is the supreme leader of chocolates
had this moment when i was about  it was late i was hungry i normally never make sandwiches but that night was different it was special ive been a different man ever since
grow your hair out make it into a ponytail or a bun and become an extremely sexy samurai looking man
as someone who has no idea how the whole process works this was a fascinating video to watch very informative and taught me a lot im very happy things are working out for you
aw man d poor little guy my condolences
now you too can pet trico all you want in the last guardian vr
of course
i know this sounds dumb but the last guardian vr legitimately made me tear up there was a time i didnt even think the game was gonna come out and now you get to experience it in virtual reality what a time to be alive
happy birthday man youre one of the most talented guys i know and im glad weve gotten to know each a bit more this year hope you have a fantastic birthday d
breaks my heart to see stuff like this bullies never win in the long run for anyone being bullied please stay strong because it does get better and you will amount to so much more than your bullies ever will also hang in there keaton youre great
incredible news super happy the game is getting the recognition it deserves a truly memorable experience
everyone thinks you guys are being cute but youre both monsters
cheer up buttercup d ill bring over treats

lets go over last weeks numbers as i sip on my scotch and chew cigars
happy birthday you old son of a gun

same exact reason haha just having a globe felt a little pointless but this is practical too
touch

some of us would be glad to shovel some snow oliver
only every day of my life
ill kill you
well at least thats all the cities near you then heres its super snowy like  mins away but not here d
everyones getting snow except us
i feel like its easy to just say oh well ill be fine and keep creating stuff for your own audience but thats a very selfish stance to have this issue is affecting a lot more people than a usual algorithm mess up its very damaging to a lot of channels
its everything really its one small trend that bleeds into another and suddenly thats the new normal everyones afraid of each other now and trying their best to make their thing the best on its own rather than being part of the whole
you bet your ass there will be
i hate you
the shadow of the colossus remake comes out a day before my birthday its meant to be
this is great haha thank you

oh excuse me sir sorry sir
you been workin out bro new haircut
by that logic i look like every person with brown hair
yeah i saw it after its pretty messed up
im really glad you liked it d
i think the game just course corrects itself all the time regardless
i have this one too  had it for my phone and switch before i got the vive thing sadly its too bulky to fit in the little holster
im very sorry to hear this is happening to you please dont give up on anything because of some other person being terrible towards you i would love to see your art and im sorry if i ever gave credit to someone else for your hard work

happy birthday dude you dont look a day over
a solid and admirable initiative always nice to use experience and influence to make it easier for up and comers
sending positive vibes to you and your family
its the fucking worst
im also weirdly named ben
a lot of people also use their influence very selfishly to gain more
bit of everything really world seems full of really shitty people lately
glad to hear it feels like that at least  thank you
friendly reminder that anyone who has any sort of influence or power over others should use that influence responsibly build others up help people be a decent human dont use it to belittle others or manipulate them to make yourself feel more important
where were you in my time of need
this is a great video
not only am i on the team im the fucking captain of that team
it is literally too late to order pizza right now
have you ever had a more perfect moment for that picture that now
hey body i appreciate your craving for pizza but its am so could you not
im convinced its magic at this point some people are just vocal wizards
you ever see someone funny and think holy shit how did they do that how can i be like them all the time
ok the wheels are somewhat back on the rails only a few people were injured in the great technology drought of  we can make this
abort abort technology caught on to my enthusiasm and has spent all day punishing me production has halted pray to the techno gods
go get it sky
yeah he looks like a bald old cop
without a shred of doubt
i never miss that pratt
tom holland is my son so yeah pretty much
its basically goosebumps lol
ill settle for anything spiderman related lol
he finally has spider sense
didnt like it at first but its growing on me
think you missed caps glo up
he a strong boy
he looks like snake from metal gear solid and its awesome
choked by t h i c c n o s
i did but he using that gun instead of using his good looks and metal arm to destroy
bout damn time
my boy spidey got that upgrade
im always productive
it is
woke up much earlier today and im gonna roundhouse kick the rest of this day in the face put it in a choke hold and make it submit to my raw energy
fukfuk
this amount of hair is unbearable
shhhh its a secret
thats ok the suit held me together
loved it haha
i liked a  video  camping with my son
lookin fresh
i think its to show off more than anything for a lot of people like more tracks must mean better edits seems like you have an incredibly efficient timeline which is admirable
its definitely an easier pitfall to fall into than i think people realise admitting it and becoming self aware is a very important step towards overcoming it though i think more people could do with being this honest with themselves
thats so awesome dude congrats
i have been asked to play doki doki literature club by about a  million people but warning its not what it appears to be
good shit
i have its really funny p
will definitely look em up thanks gab d
hell yes
no
the doors were my favourite one haha
so good
yeah youd see one every  episodes win lol
thats where it would play all day and id watch every minute of it haha
ah yes good old takeshi himself
i would watch it all day sometimes when i was younger
anyone else remember takeshis castle man i miss that show
congrats man youre a good bean
thank you for bringing this to my timeline
several
dumb
might wanna see a doctor
this is also true
my head is more than just a hat rack its also a dumb container
i cant do anything about it the copyright holders blocked it in certain countries im very sorry
i for one welcome our new lord and saviour
it essentially means the letter k which when put all together sounds like someone doing like a throat giggle i think so anyway haha
yeah its basically a documentary on his time playing andy kauffman in man on the moon very cool to see the behind the scenes and how far he pushed things
oh yeah for sure i think now hes just more open about how troubled he was back then also explains some of the roles and movies he did at those times
that trying to endlessly please other people is not the key to happiness
good choices
of course
always and forever
bit of both hes definitely in a very strange mental state right now as a cause of everything he endured but i wouldnt say it ruins anything
some of what he was saying is worrying and i wouldnt agree with them but its interesting to listen to hes had a weird life
as someone who grew up adoring jim carrey watching jim and andy on netflix is fascinating really makes you look at him and his life in a different way
how dare you
so good
youre a good man matt
happy birthday day hope you have a wonderful time
hell understand the denim underwear idea soon enough gonna pitch it to him at christmas when he invites me over
it comes with another pair of all rubber underwear for twice the price of the denim ones
i receive payment in blood that has been soaked into the denim through chafing
and thats exactly why you wont be invited to my celebration on my blimp
perhaps you havent heard of extreme body conditioning
everyone including pets
well lets hear your great idea ariona
all underwear all denim all the time
amazing ideas take time
its actually a new shape of underwear that fits all humans equally and also some animals it comes in one size too
denim underwear
shake and chafe
that was actually a stool for the king kong musical they had the night before im actually  foot
heres a picture of me telling a crowd of people in amsterdam my dream of opening an all demin underwear store they thought i was joking
haha dammit
thiccsgiving thiccmas
"happy thanksgiving to all of you out there who celebrate it even though we dont celebrate it over here im still thankful for all of you being here and sharing this amazing part of my life with me 
eat lots of food laugh loudly and stay safe today"
thats awesome huge congrats all round
obama finally answered your calls
finally drinking a grown ups drink japanese whiskey is that
christmas is the perfect time to become a glitch grinch
does he involuntarily burp when he lies about it too haha
has any one seen my brain it was last spotted making mistakes in scheduling videos this morning havent seen it since
hell fire dark fire
a whole new rug
so weird im listening to that right now haha
been listening to disney songs all day which ones your favourite
for now yes theyre the ones currently dealing with it very soon
some companies in america want to charge people more for faster internet speeds on certain sites basically everything becomes faster or slower depending on how much is paid to them and they do as they please
its all over the internet gotta use this influence responsibly for the things that matter
money and control its the reason for most evil in this world
new developments from the fcc happening very soon which is why its so prevalent today
the internet is an amazing place it has given me more than i could have ever asked forwe need to protect it and keep it a fair place for all  is an incredibly important topic right now thats worth taking action for
i make all my thumbnails
i told you it would make sense eventually
i would love a decent open world futurama game
gonna collab with  soon with all this squirrel action im getting
i almost got one of the squirrels to eat straight from my hand dreams are becoming reality
song of people song of people
hell no its my boy dash
can i get a good open world game based on the incredibles now thanks
i might just record that one not sure yet im late to episode  a lot late so i wanted to not make people wait even longer
yep
streaming batman episode  in about  hours on youtube
super fun game
fuck sake haha
dont go giving me a big head sky my shoulders wouldnt be able to hold it up p
right back at ya sky boy
"bitch sit down
be humble"
lets go over here just you and me
thats awesome dude so happy for you
exactly too many people willing to throw their ideals and morals away because of this stuff which just adds to the pile then and the cycle grows and morphs and the thats the new norm
sorry to hear that dude my cuphead video today got demonetised when it was only  uploaded no idea how that even happens lol
right back at you dude appreciate the love
the fact that we just dont know if its a bad video or if its wven reaching people or not is messed on its own more info and data is always helpful
in a way im glad other people have noticed it too and im not crazy really sucks though
means a lot coming from you my dude  high five up top my home man
its one of those things where you have people who are that energetic naturally that get popular and then everyone thinks thats the reason that made said person popular so they repeat it and the cycle grows  so many people making gaming content now
ill kill you
lets hope
so much needless stress too if people knew what was going on or what was about to go on then people could plan adjust accept a lot easier
its not so much about what genres die off that worries me its what takes its place that does were already seeing a trend of what type of shitty content youtube and the masses love to push to the forefront
sadden me yeah but it wont discourage me from making my content  as you said for the community first and foremost
no it will take a lot more for me to stop entirely
i will always try and find an outlet to do this so of course if yt went belly up i wouldnt just abandon it all
im not saying any of this because of my channel or any selfish reasons im saying it because i love youtube and making videos and i used to see a lot of like minded people around which lead to a great atmosphere its a shame we might never get that back
feels like it at least haha
theres a far stronger emphasis on get rich quick with youtube now than ever before its always kind of been there but its slowly getting worse i miss the sincerity and passion in people who created videos for youtube that was the whole reason i started
not only that but no one really seems to know whats going on with the algorithm anymore which leads to youtubers just uploading all sorts of random stuff to see what sticks or trends next its like the wild west with everyone just out for themselves
so i had a bright idea drink alcohol and play the wolds easiest game
oh santa why
fa la la la laaaaaa
"only if they follow the link below

there is no link"
so you could literally say chewing on this ding dong
im always ready for snow but snow is never ready for me
hell yeah it is
with the help of the ding dong im sure it will be
christmas time in brighton heh heh
finally a good use of  characters
you punched a whole band and stole their hat
fantastic game and it really had an impact on me made me think about a lot of things in my life
i have the power of anime and god on my side
but its so fun
surprise
cuphead mario zelda aco night in the woods so many
very gonna miss it
happy birthday

this makes me happy and i hope everything is ok keep that chin up

aigooo nuna gamsa gamsa
such a cool place would love to go back someday the food is the best part
we should all watch it together o

clearly im on top of my thumbnail name game
"love is in the aireverywhere i look around
oh wait thats not love 
dear god ruuuuuun"
actually megan
thats my secret captain
the womb
do i look like a doctor
doctor fixed me up he said it was just hemorrhoids
ill kill you
that looks like me on the front lol
if only
king dice just has shitty attacks that feel unfair and you have to fight several other bosses to even attempt him
several times
thousand
im fine
you will see pure unfiltered rage in the video
from what ive seen coop makes the whole game much harder just cos of all the shit on screen
i want murder
only if its free for fans
i did eventually after like an hour lol im not looking forward to the devil fight
it doesnt actually lol at least not the lyric version
in a manner of speaking
it very well might just be a gateway into insanity
nothing will ever be that bad but it got close
you dont know where my ass has been
the king dice boss fight in cuphead can suck the very most inner deep sanctum of my asshole
it was all planned
you guys ever have a craving for brains
doctor said its probably a cough but i dunno
phew glad to hear
thanks man was worried i looked a bit pale
must be just that time of year i guess best to be sure yano
feeling a bit ill might go see a doctor just to be sure
good job australia nice to see progress spreading around the world heres to a brighter future
i miss those bf times and even bfbc their games havent been as fun as those for a long time

only for fans kellie
happy birthday hope you have a wonderful day d
you are everything wrong with the world
you know i say all kinds of shit before ive had my covfefe
he a thicc boi p
i really liked it too d such a fun movie
ive become a surgeon with boxes since moving it just never stops building up fucking amazon
happy birthday
something they never warn you about when you become an adult is the amount of cardboard you accumulate
just gobbled up those nuts
i got my hands on a kit that makes the htc vive wireless and its incredible lets try out some gorn with it
happy birthday yo d hope you have a great day
woo  youtube was fucking awesome
this is fucking amazing haha i sound like a dying walrus at the end
ah shit
oh hey thanks automated robot friend good lookin out
anyone know where i can get a jumbo sam plush for free asking for a friend
hes incredible
robins working on a jackieboyman animation
dont worry ken you still make my heart go doki doki
yeah ive noticed it too gaming is doing terribly now and you can clearly tell when a video doesnt get sent to everyone
all the work of the super talented  it came out so good glad you guys think so too
no one wants a messy burrito
believe me you think you know crazy but you dont know kpop crazy
kpop fandoms are the most intense i have ever seen
i went deep down that hole a long time ago haha never again
"me watches kpop
also me im gonna learn how to dance"
thats so awesome congrats you guys d wishing you all the happiness going forward
spoiler its not p
ye boi check my tweet earlier p
yeah i could spin in circles no problem now lol
everyone does now p
every htc vive game from now on
its been out for a while but not for the public to buy robin just saw it for sale recently so i jumped on it now its a pretty steep price for what it is but totally worth it for me
of course
played with the wireless vive for a bit and its incredible no lag whatsoever at least when playing gorn and it felt like just using it regularly except now i can bounce around like a rabbit completely blown away by it
the headstrap is a necessity id say makes such a difference towards ease of use
hopefully its good also gree on the rift being more comfy and also has the best controllers too shame its tracking is worse
now all i have to do is worry about banging into furniture on my new adventures
any answer but black is  the wrong answer
will update whenever i get a chance to try it out
i just got it from a computer store online i regularly use you can find stores from their site
gonna try record something with it today hopefully
yeah it just uses a regular mobile power bank so i reckon itll drain pretty quick most vive sessions i do are like  mins anyway so it should be fine
haha probably not they got annoying pretty quick
not really i just took my time to make sure i didnt break anything lol
its not connected directly to my pc anymore with cables running along the ground meaning i can now walk anywhere without cables pulling at my computer
good to hear d
this is the whole thing when its put together need to test for laglatency later
except it did after  minutes lol
yeah the vive sensors need to be ft apart at max though
yep you can move freely
dunno what the best test would be probably gorn
way dude
got a kit today that makes the htc vive wireless and i am so excited to try it out
theyve all been demonetised because of the thumbnails lol
surprised the thumbnail even made it passed demonetisation thats terrifying
green apples son
"the next big food debate

oui oui
are you staring at a mirror again craig
hyped
mario odyssey makes me wanna go around throwing hats at everything in real life
he found it with dustin
you know your boy got them squishy cheeks
feelin dapper
nope got hit with  claims and then edited out those parts then they just claimed some other parts instead when i reuploaded
same first episode got blasted with claims
happy birthday my dude d
trapped in space
well my underwear was dirty so yeah
time changed here last night so might seem like the schedule is different for some of youhavent forgotten to upload and nothing is wrong
i need a buddy show with just them solving crimes
its still pretty damn good a worthy sequel
he was awesome this season
agreed and agreed
surprisingly yeah haha must have been fun to act
hell yeah its great
same i kept making references to it while watching lol
sean astins character is my favourite this season such a fun bubbly character hes so cute
he got so much better this season he did a great job
yeah its nice to see them grow and become more independent i just prefer the group bond vibe more not bad at all
sure did some of the hopper scenes were fantastic
repeating ideas from season  but having them be less focused splitting characters up also lost some of that bondcharm
the overall pacing and plot points were way more focused season
yep
i guess that bond and strong connection was the best part of season  though so losing some of that was sad
he definitely got much better he was pretty bad in season  but he hugely improved this time
always
pacing felt way worse this season some plot points just went nowhere and were unnecessary
just finished the season not as good as season  but still very fun everyone got much better at acting this time wish there was more p
im done now
cos of these pearly whites
i just did
dart x nougat
dustin and steves bromance is my favourite thing about stranger things season

wouldnt expect any less from the two time
thats awesome d welcome to the club
being popular is the only goal some people have in life therefore life is a never ending popularity contest and everyone else a competitor
it was amazing haha

you will always be our blue boi
raw data makes me feel like the super powered ninja ive always wanted to be
"still look just as cynical and ready to debunk

my dark shadow boi
aw so sweet thank you
i just tried this in the video and have no idea what it means could you elaborate so i know how wrong i was p
i hate having companions in games period i always feel like theyre judging me or want me to get on with it
jeez vintage memes d
wasnt intentionally made to do that but i can definitely see it that way hence the change
thanks for the tip d ill try it next time
true friendship
nah i know nothing about homestuck it adds to it but not necessary
didnt know at the time so apologies for putting it all on toby the soundtrack is fantastic d vinyl please haha
really my god thats a lot of options haha i love it
the soundtrack is fantastic
this thumbnail is a  g o o d b o y e
it was also a reason i decided to give it a shot  people were reminded of undertale and asked me to play this
i know almost nothing about homestuck or hiveswap but this game is absolutely fantastic so far
reminder to check in with people every now and then in case they think youre dead
"thumbnail has been found motherfucker was out drinking all night with friends
thank you all for the support and help in searching"
apparently they were last seen with someone named  internal server error really worried now ive heard terrible things about them
called the thumbnails parents and they have no idea where he isthey thought he was with me will ask around a bit more
hey there was a thumbnail on that video whered it run off to get back here
when the new fog rolls in jack kicks ass
iconic

this is so god damn cute
sounds like a damn good time happy birthday d
i technically missed it in my timezone but happy birthday dude d
shes precious
will be in dublin with the game grumps in october
cant give away the secrets p
no i know its unfair for those who cant go but it would also be unfair to stream it if people paid money to see it live
a bit ill probably be more nervous right before it more excited nerves though
it makes sense for the show it fits the theme of what were trying to do
whenever we figure out when it is trying to just get this one right first
of course d
the reactions people have i think its a different type of show than people are expecting
solo tour
all the shows for the start of the tour are now sold out thats crazy d thank you so much i cant wait to see some of you there
happy birthday my good man
happy birthday may all your dreams come true and even some extra ones d
eggsy the duck motorboat learns to swim and destroy his enemies
google or apple  would you rather   via
oh man i remember that stuff always tasted like medicine to me haha
firm handshakes
what a hunky boy
hopefully still need to work on some of my chops but its getting there
this was fantastic haha
hell yeah i am this game brings me so much agony but im addicted
is this the end of rock of ages theres nothing greater than beating god
you got it
still working on more covers but i got new pieces for the kit and wanted to show them
oh my god that was you i knew you looked familiar haha
you did it the dream d super excited for you especially as a fellow dirty bean lover
so damn excited
not sure yet love the idea of it though
things arent that bad haha
butt cam here i come
if advertisers leave youtube then theres no money to run the site
yes of course i have thousands of videos to make up the difference p
you can still watch it
in  weeks p
even then we still dont know it just says not suitable for all advertisers and we have to guess what triggered that and try to remove it
i wont be lol its not that bad
already uploaded the whole game when it came out p
i wouldnt even mind prepping but i have like  days between the tours so its physically impossible hopefully people understand
if yt really did fall apart and i couldnt do that anymore twitch would be the first option i think theyre good people over there
nah i dont really have anything new to add to the pile of videos on it already
same here some channels that were barely getting by are now getting screwed and i hope it doesnt drive people away
yeah theres a misconception that large channels are immune too but no everyone is being hit pretty hard i think
to appease advertisers and to entice funding back into the site
man id collab with ray regardless lol
im trying to prep double uploads for my tour but for grumps tour its impossible might have to take a complete break cos its  days
the channel is fine and im not going anywhere people were just curious if the adpocalypse affected me since its a big problem lately
oh jesus
yeah her rating dogs video got flagged at one point which was just silly haha its fixed now though
well doing youtube can always be a super fun hobby it doesnt always have to be a job id say try it anyway
thankfully no im lucky enough to have a huge library of videos to offset the loss it makes me worry for less frequent uploaders though
it makes me sad too its already hard enough do this and i got super lucky for smaller channels this literally kills them
anything they deem not suitable to run certain ads on
no sadly its all on youtube and we either censor things to buckle under or ride out the wave
for clarification this isnt the only video ive had flagged about a month ago roughly  of my vids were flagged half were appealed
oh beans you guys are in for a hell of a ride
jesus sorry to hear that guys
the all the way song got flagged by youtube as not suitable for all advertisers because it had happy wheels in it
jared leto method acting all the way
aw hell ye dawg
fantastic game
same i will try my best
happy birthday my dude hope you have a wonderful time d
what a roller coaster of a tweet cant wait for the movie

with the hurricanes happening lately were selling special gold shirts all proceeds go to helping the relief fund
yeah i lowered it and pitch shifted too to try get around it but the only solution would have been silence it seems
every episode of the first game are claimed as well have been for a long time they just didnt get blocked
except the music happens at some points where nice calmer moments are happening and talking would ruin those
seems like it got blocked in most countries outside the us
this has been the most troublesome video ive uploaded so i apologise for how messy its been
still had copyright issues on the video so if its still blocked for you i uploaded to twitch too as a solution
life is strange is back and its as hella cool as ever

listening to it right now p
undertale got announced for the ps and ps vita which is awesome dont know how it will work but more people getting to play it is great
a true professional
its a good movie it just didnt blow me away like i expected it did make me hungry however
well i also watched it for the first time like last year so i didnt get the wow factor for the time it released in
im saying for this particular showing it was a lot of them in a short span of time
it was contained in a story segment though i wanna see how free and open the non mission stuff is
quick time event
yep they nailed it last year but this one fell flat
possibly still a shame we didnt get more swangin
i will admit they werent as obnoxious as some games
of course but still a bad showcase of what the game has to offer
they even made detroit look more dull than last years debut too which was sad but i agree
yup full series
metro exodus
excited but worried
sad not to see more of it either but it is a long way off still
true its a great surprise but the overall conference was weak
excited for spiderman ps but that wasnt a very good showcase too many qtes and indoor fightingnot enough web swinging through the city
thats about all yeah spidermans showing was pretty rough too lots of qte
pretty shit overall
only saved by sotc
its real pam dreams come true
this is the best day my favourite game of all time being remade just for meeeee
shadow of the colossus remake holy fucking shit

woopsies
believe in yourself and you can accomplish great things
its all guts and glory until someone loses their arms
fuck
good to see you looking like yourself again
they should instead of  different uploads getting  different sets of claims thats my biggest issue with it
nope its always for visual content at completely random sections of races
dont get me wrong im still uploading it anyway i just dont like how random and unclear the system is it makes no sense
usually seeing what gets claimed and editing that out works but this time they just claimed a different part instead
"upload mario kart 
this contains copyright content
edits out copyright and reuploads
gets claimed for a different part entirely instead"
youre an old man sam

you think you can beat these skillz
waaaahhhhh
cant believe you spun without me
nah a lot of them just dont fit my lets play style mario maker and kart are a bit different
could have edited it a bit differently i guess but it was for super random parts of the video so its unlikely to have worked
they get all the money from the ads on the video
visual match so its just an auto claim for anything regarding their content
fun fact nintendo claimed this video  separate times  seconds after uploading and scheduling it
glad you got it hha
disconnection p
im not a sheep though
beep beep get out of the way jack and waluigi are rolling through in mario kart  deluxe
couldnt agree more one of the worst movies ive seen
exactly what happened the time was set for today instead of tomorrow so it auto published p
accidental upload oopsies quick look over there

if you want no homework in kindergarten then just get rid of all the students
wade bob mark or jack who will be dead by daylight

congrats buddy
a song that gets a whole crowd to sit still and listen is far from boring
perfectly fine
ok the yodelling was pretty baller ill admit still sad about sax man

to be fair portugal deserved to win they were the most unique act in a show full of generic music
you dont like a creepy guy singing asmr style into your ear holes as he molests the air
its garbage because pacing is everything and you fucked it up
dude edna mode giving out the points for australia

"people arent giving  points to moldova and it saddens me 
rigged"
it was a pretty great arse to be fair

is there anything more terrifying than jacksepticeye with lots of guns
love the ending line
top  anime betrayals
you look like a starting rpg character who just equips the best random armor they pick up
read the manga instead its way better p
you think thats excellent storytelling lol i dont think either aot season has excellent storytelling
aot always drags thats its thing s is still better
the newest episode was a bit groan worthy
i think a few episodes dragged a good bit but some scenes and reveals have really redeemed it shits gonna go off towards the end
even having read the manga and knowing what happens it still had my heart racing
the final scene in the new attack on titan episode is so damn good both music and the visuals the really nailed it bout time it showed it
long game too many parts and i also just want a game for me time and prey is something ive been excited to do that with
everything is a lie and nothing is real in prey keep your eyes open
see it actually is sunny here no foolies
its only the first episode and im already in love with little nightmares
of course i even want one myself haha just the using for views trend thats silly p

wheres the toilet paper
i just forcefully eject all matter at such velocity that its not needed
those assholes well see who has the last laugh

my toilet had a fetch quest to deliver poop
a real soldier wipes with sheer force
god knew it was time and shone a light on my throne this day

move the payload
its all the alcohol it gives you leather skin
its the weirdest haha
the auto generated smile is super creepy looking
the auto generated old man face on faceapp makes me look exactly like my dad
who knew uno could be such an exhilarating and hilarious game
its just because you keep mentioning me constantly people come for spedicey
build your own fort and defend it while blasting your enemies with all sorts of explosive potential
uh sahhhh
its so good
another compilation of outtakes that dont make the final cut along with some silly bloopers
damn
wait today is national high five day my day is finally here
bored burgers man
appreciate you guys d keep up the stellar work and happy launch i mean squanch day
you guys nailed it d cant wait to play more of it
ive been waiting a long time for rick and morty vr to come out and its finally here
its easy to fall into trends much harder to go against them respect
this is super cool haha
amazing haha
biggest producer of music across a lot of genres dude really has done it all
ricks voice is like butter too which was such a shock the first time i heard it haha
yep con people before they realise that you dont actually have anything of substance to back it up its so transparent
exactly the channels that front load their content with all of that stuff just telling your viewers to hit the bell isnt bad
i get that i have no issue with people reminding their viewers the problem is when the begging happens before the actual content
thats ridiculous people on youtube wouldnt scam their audience for more money he sarcastically lied
regular or pro this is important
lots of people it seems lol
do you comment though you wont win unless you comment saying that you subbed
sick
me bro
youre both being very uncool right now
nama groot
weve all dabbled in it from time to time sont be too hard on yourself
can i make a silk robe from it
just like clickbait it sucks because it works and then becomes the norm
hopefully the cycle doesnt repeat there too p keep yer head on a swivel
have to sell my lambo cos cpms dropped
yeah it really turns me away when the first minute is gross manipulation and pandering
damn congrats brother
too fuggin true
ill rip your dick off if i dont like it
"im gonna vlog every day 
stops a week later lol"
watching it now solely based off this tweet haha i trust your judgement
thank you guys for always being real with me
is that jerry in that back again that motherf
achievements not astonishments
create because you want to create not because you saw how much shit someone could buy as a result of popularity
more
any day i get to look at chris pratt lore the better
couldnt agree more
already recorded and ready to upload tomorrow
its become the norm and up and comers think they need to do it to make it
"hits toe on bed 
the day i almost died fam"
i really shouldnt be thanked for just being a decent person lol
happy birthday
there is some of it in the live scene too but far less some of my favourite creators these days are live streamers
same with clickbait its most sad because it works
audience manipulation
yep just incentive to engage more
i mean my outro says to punch the like button but its more for outro sake than for the actual likes lol
because theyve become incredibly entitled
pretty much yt is full of narcissists now trying to show how much they have and how fast they can get it the balance has shifted wildly
bees for everyone
sadly its not about content or a meaningful experience its all about how fast you can gain
cos i hate it haha i dont want to become that
billion likes
except its all cosmetic for ego purposes watch time is still king but you cant show that off to everyone so likes and subs need to rise
yeah it turns me away immediately
not really since it happens after the click
the weird justifications for it are ridiculous god forbid anyone just tries to have fun p
well they keep getting rewarded for it so i dont think they really care sadly
thats definitely the worst lol
boosts engagement which people think gains higher search rankings its also a pet peeve of mine
you can win free money
i have always said i will never become that type of youtuber its so gross
takes like a full minute or two for the actual video to even start everyones so obsessed with gaining more and more
so many channels on yt lately start with  subscribe comment that you did hit the bell get this video to k likes i have a giveaway
days in a row we are blessed
i needs it
high brow comedy i got goin on here p
this time were going head to head in orcs must die unchained who will win
if you could clone yourself what would you do would you trust them
watched it for the first time about a month or so ago its uh weird haha some crazy cool transitions in it though
happy birthday to my wonderful lil  hope you have the best time and get showered with all the love you deserve

gotem
i want a gin rummy election next i like the sound of that
think thats why i like wall e so much earth is desolate and brown where as the space ship is super vibrant and in your face great contrast
well not really but a lot of their stuff uses colour very well and its quite vibrant which makes people think its for kids
i was trying to parody what people seem to think pixar does because of their colour palette without actually knowing anything p
but muh pixar
hello joe
