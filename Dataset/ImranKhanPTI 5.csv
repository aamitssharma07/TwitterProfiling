2022-10-24 11:28:55+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,We saw a foreign abetted regime change conspiracy taking place sending Pak into chaos. But senior Judiciary continues to remain aloof.

2022-10-13 13:26:30+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Azam Swati's custodial torture for a tweet on NRO 2 is yet another shameful act in our history.

2022-09-16 09:12:10+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Imported govt is completely directionless. The only achievement of this cabal of crooks has been to get another NRO for the billions they looted from Pakistan. The question the whole nation is asking is: Who is responsible for this conspiracy against Pakistan?
2022-09-16 09:12:09+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"in terms of growth rate (6%), industry, agriculture, employment, construction, exports, remittances &amp; tax collection - at an all time high. Now Pakistan faces unprecedented inflation hitting everyone, unemployment, food insecurity &amp; Rupee in freefall."
2022-09-16 09:12:08+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,IMF &amp; World Bank Reports show this Imported Govt has failed to prevent economy going into tailspin despite inheriting a stabilised economy moving on an upward trajectory. This was reflected in the Economic Survey which identified our econ  performance as the best in past 70 yrs
2022-09-13 17:29:46+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Their desperation led to their blacking out our Telethon for flood relief. Today they raided Senator Saif Nyazee's home &amp; took away his cell &amp; computer.

But if you are not responsible for violating our constitutional rights &amp; int commitments on freedom of press &amp; speech, then it is your responsibility to inform nation who is responsible for these actions?"

2022-09-12 06:11:34+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"This shows how petrified they are of our rising popularity amongst the nation. Also, they know no one trusts them with their money given their record of loot &amp; plunder. So they sought to deny fundraising to aid flood victims just to get at me &amp; my Party. Unbelievable callousness."
2022-09-12 06:11:33+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Imported govt of cabal of crooks &amp; their handlers stooped to new lows last night when they tried to blackout my telethon for flood relief fund raising.

Utterly callous &amp; unacceptable. #EnoughlsEnough"
2022-09-07 06:49:43+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Imported govt is so fearful of the nation rising in support of my message of Haqiqi Azadi that they are imposing complete blackout of my speeches not only from mainstream media but also by blocking YouTube. Digital censorship hurts entire IT sector &amp; damages Pak's image globally.
2022-09-06 06:16:14+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Am following intense propaganda launched by PDM cabal of crooks against me.This stems from their being petrified of PTI's soaring popularity.

2022-08-21 17:45:51+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,The fascist Imported govt sunk to a new low today by banning live coverage of my speeches on TV &amp; then blocking YouTube temporarily during my speech at Liaquat Bagh. All this after continuous intimidation of  mediapersons &amp; taking channels off air earlier.
2022-08-21 17:24:04+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"After Pemra blocked live transmission of my Pindi jalsa speech on TV channels, Imported govt blocked YouTube midway through my speech. This just shows the desperation of those who for their self interest are willing to push Pakistan towards political and economic chaos."

2022-08-19 12:28:01+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Who tortured Gill? There is a general perception in the public at large &amp; in our minds too as to who could have carried out the gruesome torture. Remember the public will react. We will leave no stone unturned to find out those responsible &amp; bring them to justice.
2022-08-17 18:36:37+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Meanwhile the likes of NS, Maryam, MFR, AZ, all of whom have in the worst possible way &amp; repeatedly attacked State institutions through malicious &amp; targeted statements against them, get away without even a hint of a reprimand."

2022-08-17 10:54:28+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Very concerned about Shahbaz Gill being sent into police remand again. He is in a fragile state of mental &amp; physical health because of the torture inflicted on him when he was abducted &amp; taken to undisclosed location &amp; then again at the police station. This is part of conspiracy

2022-08-14 11:07:34+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Others like Imran Riaz, Sami Ibrahim, Ayaz Amir have suffered threats, violent attacks &amp; arrest. In my mass public campaign across Pak from next week, I will take up issue of media freedom &amp; freedom of expression. If we allow these terror tactics, designed simply to target PTI"

2022-08-12 05:57:10+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Judiciary needs to take notice of this. Ary's news editor was picked up violently late night from his home without warrant &amp; a wife with suckling baby picked up illegally bec her husband worked for Gill. A climate of fear is being spread to make ppl kowtow before cabal of crooks.
2022-08-12 05:57:10+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Strongly condemn the torture being inflicted on Shahbaz Gill. Under what law &amp; under who's orders is this being done? If he broke any law then he shd be given a fair hearing. But just to salvage Imported govt of crooks the Constitution &amp; all laws are being violated with impunity.
2022-08-11 07:38:55+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Imported govt of cabal of crooks brought thru foreign backed regime change is using fear &amp; terror in media &amp; ppl to gain acceptance after being routed in Punjab elections.But all they are succeeding in doing is further destabilising country.

2022-08-05 06:10:09+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,But the Kashmiris' spirit of resistance became stronger &amp; it continues to strengthen. The selective morality of the international community &amp; silence against India's brazen violations of all int laws &amp; UN SC resolutions is condemnable.
2022-08-05 06:07:22+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,On 5 Aug 2019 Modi govt violated UN SC resolutions &amp; int law by illegally revoking Special Status of IIOJK. Modi govt then moved to commit a war crime under Fourth Geneva Convention by altering demography of IIOJK. They assumed the moves would crush spirit of Kashmiri resistance

2022-07-23 08:41:51+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"In just over 3 mths the Zardari - Sharifs' mafia has brought the country to its knees politically &amp; economically;
 simply to save their illegally accumulated wealth amassed over 30 yrs of plundering Pakistan. My question is:how long will State institutions continue to allow this?"
2022-07-21 09:59:23+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"they must now protect their mandate by coming out to protest today across Pak. I will address the protests at 9 pm tonight. Let Sri Lanka be a reminder as a clear message goes to cabal of crooks,their handlers &amp; ECP that people wiĺl not allow you to steal their mandate in Punjab."
2022-07-21 09:59:22+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Now the Kings of Crime, Zardari &amp; SS having gotten their NRO2 are using their salvaged looted money to purchase Punjab MPAs making a mockery of laws &amp; desecrating our Constitution.I am asking ppl of Pak that just as they came out &amp; thwarted plan to steal Punjab election on 17July"
2022-07-21 09:59:22+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Imported govt brought in by US regime change conspiracy first tried to rig Punjab bye elections thru govt &amp; state machinery abetted by dishonest &amp; biased CEC Sikandar Sultan heading non credible ECP. A highly aware &amp; resolute public stood firm ensuring failure of nefarious design
2022-07-20 13:50:21+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Isn't destruction of our democracy, Constitution &amp; nation's morality a fit case for Suo Moto action? Are the ""Neutrals"" not realising how our beloved country is literally being destroyed on all fronts by the Imported govt brought in through US regime change conspiracy?"
2022-07-20 13:50:21+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"After Fed govt toppled with stolen money from Sindh &amp; NRO2 achieved, Certified Criminal Asif Zardari in cahoots with Sharif mafia now seeking to steal Punjab ppl's mandate by trying to purchase MPAs. Want to ask Honourable SC are they not cogniscant of the damage being wreaked?"
2022-07-20 12:33:40+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,This is not only an attack on our democracy but also on moral fabric of our society. Had SC taken action &amp; debarred these turncoats for life it would have acted as deterrent. Don't Handlers of US regime change conspiracy's Imported govt realise severe damage being done to nation?
2022-07-20 12:33:39+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Today Lahore is seeing a repeat of the Sindh House horse trading that happened in Islamabad with upto Rs 50 crores being offered to buy MPAs. The main architect behind this is Asif Zardari who gets NRO for his corruption &amp; purchases people with looted wealth. He shd be jailed.
2022-07-19 10:36:45+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,The nation will hold accountable all those responsible for regime change conspiracy &amp; bringing Pakistan to this sorry state of affairs.
2022-07-19 10:36:44+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"When US regime conspiracy's VoNC was tabled $ was at Rs 178. Today it is Rs 224 &amp; in freefall despite IMF agreement. The economic meltdown shows Sharifs never had any expertise in running economy or administration. Their only expertise is looting, money laundering &amp; getting NROs"
2022-07-17 17:59:26+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,The only way forward from here is to hold fair &amp; free elections under a credible ECP. Any other path will only lead to greater political uncertainty &amp; further economic chaos.
2022-07-17 14:10:56+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,As results coming in PTI is winning in atleast 15 seats. But it is very important for all our people on duty in all polling stations not to leave their posts till official results have been obtained from the Returning Officers.
2022-07-17 12:03:27+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Today Punjab govt has brazenly violated SC orders &amp; election rules by openly using all govt/State machinery to rig Punjab elections through illegal ballot stamping &amp; harrassing voters while arresting PTI ldrs. Through it all ECP turned a blind eye. Courts must open now &amp; act.
2022-07-17 11:14:14+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Strongly condemn illegal arrest of Shahbaz Gill simply to try &amp; rig elections &amp; spread fear in ppl. These fascist tactics will not work &amp; our ppl will not be deterred from exercising their right to vote. Handlers of Imported govt should realise damage they are doing to our nation
2022-07-17 08:41:36+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"I am pleased to see our voters coming out to cast their votes in large numbers &amp; resisting all pressures &amp; harassment. I want all those, esp our women, who have to still come out to cast their vote to do so as this is an election for Pakistan's sovereignty &amp; Haqeeqi Azadi."
2022-07-15 04:30:44+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,I extend my congratulations to President Erdogan &amp; the people of Turkiye on Democracy &amp; National Unity Day of Turkiye (Demokrasi ve Milli Birlik Günü). 15 July 2016 commemorates the day President Erdogan with the support of the Turkish people defeated attempted coup against him.
2022-07-12 09:25:26+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Rains have once again exposed 14 years corrupt rule of Zardari &amp; family in Sindh. This is a classic example of how Corruption ruins Governance. Money given to Karachi ended up in Fake Accounts and invested in Dubai properties. This nexus of evil must be brought to an end.
2022-07-11 13:43:05+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Flooding of Karachi bec of rains again a reflection of PPP's 14 yrs of corruption &amp; mismanagement in governing Sindh. My govt had given Rs35bn to clean &amp; reconstruct major nullahs but prov govt failed to perform it's task of improving solid waste disposal &amp; cleaning minor nullahs
2022-07-10 03:16:17+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Wishing Muslims everywhere Eid Mubarak. As we celebrate &amp; thank Allah for his blessings this Eid that commemorates sacrifice, let us remember &amp; pray for those who are without their loved ones &amp; for the people of IIOJK &amp; Palestine suffering oppression under brutal Occupation."
2022-07-09 17:57:33+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,But all this is doing is stoking a dangerous slide into anarchy by pitting the people against the govt. #PakistanUnderFascism
2022-07-08 05:43:39+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"I am afraid neither the PDM parties, who have perfected the art of rigging over the years want free and fair elections, nor does our Establishment."
2022-07-06 09:58:43+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Unless we all unite and stand up against this fascism it will be the end of democracy and freedom in Pakistan.
2022-07-06 09:58:42+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,All those who support democracy &amp; the right to freedom of expression as enshrined in our Constitution must come out &amp; protest against arrest of @ImranRiazKhan &amp; ongoing violence &amp; targeting of journalists incl @ayazamir &amp; many others just to instil fear &amp; silence critical voices.
2022-07-05 19:11:21+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"I strongly condemn the arbitrary arrest of @ImranRiazKhan by Punjab police tonight. The country is descending into fascism just to make our nation accept an Imported Govt comprising of mega crooks. It is time for everyone, esp the media, to unite &amp; stand up against this fascism."
2022-07-05 10:56:33+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"This was despite the sharp slow down after regime change conspiracy operationalised. In July '21-March '22, under PTI Govt exports grew 27%. In June under cabal of crooks export growth slowed to 5.8%. #امپورٹڈ_حکومت_نامنظور"
2022-07-05 10:56:32+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"The nation continues to suffer crushing economic cost of Imported Govt brought in thru US regime change conspiracy at a time when our govt had stabilised the economy. Exports, which stagnated in previous PMLN Govt at $25 bn, crossed $30 bn for the first time this yr to $31.76 bn"
2022-07-01 17:52:26+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"I condemn in strongest terms the violence against senior journalist Ayaz Amir today in Lahore. Pak  descending into the worst kind of fascism with violence &amp; fake FIRs against journalists,opp politicians, citizens.When the State loses all moral authority it resorts to violence."
2022-07-01 10:37:06+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,InshaAllah tomorrow will be our historic Islamabad jalsa at Parade Ground against Imported govt's pol destabilisation &amp; crushing our people under the burden of excessive loadshedding in peak of summer &amp; spiralling fuel prices. I will be leading a rally from Pindi to Parade Ground
2022-06-27 11:41:20+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,On 2 July we will hold peaceful protests across Pakistan against Imported govt imposed on Pak by US regime change conspiracy &amp; the NRO2 they engineered to save their Rs 1100 bn corruption plus spiralling prices crushing nation. I will lead the Islamabad protest at Parade Ground.
2022-06-25 16:26:28+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"LBEs are to be held in 4 divs of Sindh. Despite PPP terrorising our candidates &amp; not following SC orders to devolve authority to local reps under Art 140A, we are taking part in the elections. 
I ask people of Sindh to vote for PTI candidates &amp; eliminate the #ZardariMafia"
2022-06-23 14:48:14+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Innā li-Llāhi wa inna ilayhi rāji'ūn. 
Saddened to learn of the passing of  Shaykh Mahmud Effendi of Turkey.  He revived Islam &amp; Sunnah at a  challenging time, inspiring millions of people in #Turkey &amp; around the World. 
A great loss for the Ummah."
2022-06-22 08:41:21+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,My condolences &amp; prayers go to the Govt &amp; people of Afghanistan for the loss of lives suffered in the earthquake. I have asked the KP Govt to especially facilitate provision of all medical assistance.
2022-06-20 08:13:27+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Rs 1100 bn of the Rs 1200 bn that was being investigated by NAB will now be out of NAB's jurisdiction, giving this criminal mafia their NRO2. History will neither forget nor forgive all those who were part of &amp; enabled this conspiracy against Pakistan to succeed."
2022-06-20 08:13:27+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Our Prophet PBUH had said societies are destroyed when the poor are jailed while the rich are not held accountable. Today, with this one amended NAB law we are heading towards destruction by removing white collar criminals from accountability."
2022-06-20 08:13:26+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"At a time when our economy had stabilised &amp; was moving towards sustainable growth of 6%, the conspirators chose to destabilise Pak by sending economy into a tailspin &amp; dropping a price bomb on our ppl - just to give these criminals NRO2."
2022-06-20 08:13:25+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Today is Black Day in Pak's history when Imported govt of crooks amended NAB law comes in ending accountability. Entire economy &amp; pol system of Pak was derailed thru US-backed regime change conspiracy simply to give this cabal of crooks another NRO. PMLN's Dastgir confirmed this.
2022-06-17 15:25:55+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"I am confident that prerequisite onsite visit of FATF team to confirm completed work on our action plan will pass successfully too. Hammad Azhar, members of his FATF coord committee &amp; officers who worked on this task performed exceptionally well. The whole country is proud of you"
2022-06-17 15:25:54+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"FATF repeatedly praised work &amp; the political will my govt demonstrated. We not only averted blacklisting, but also completed 32 out of 34 action items. We submitted compliance report on remaining 2 items in April based on which FATF now declared Pak's Action Plan as completed."
2022-06-17 15:25:54+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,I constituted a FATF Coordination Committee headed by key minister Hammad Azhar. The committee had representation from all govt departments &amp; security agencies relevant to our FATF action plan. The officers worked day &amp; night in the first instance to avoid blacklisting.
2022-06-17 15:25:53+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Pak was nominated for grey listing by FATF in Feb 2018 &amp; had to complete the most challenging action plan ever given to any jurisdiction. When my govt took over, we faced dire prospect of Blacklisting by that body. Our past compliance history with FATF was also not favourable."
2022-06-16 17:44:14+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Sadly another wave of inflation is coming as Rupee devalues further - has fallen 15% (Rs 30) to the dollar since Imported govt of crooks came to power through US regime change conspiracy.
2022-06-15 09:28:26+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Police &amp; local administration have become complicit with this mafia &amp; had unleashed a reign of terror on peaceful PTI workers, ldrs &amp; their families. Now they feel they r not answerable before the people's elected ldrship. We cannot allow such anarchy &amp; criminal rule to prevail."
2022-06-15 09:28:25+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Ever since Imported Crime Minister's corrupt son illegally grabbed power in Punjab thru a farcical election there is complete political anarchy in Pak's most populous province. People suffering, farmers crops under threat, no governance in sight just a criminal mafia running riot"
2022-06-14 16:43:02+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"the Indian govt chose to target the Muslim protestors by demolishing their homes. This inhumane, fascistic action is utterly condemnable &amp; straight out of the Israeli playbook."
2022-06-14 16:43:01+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Shocking how Indian officials demolished the homes of Indian Muslims protesting against the blasphemous statements of BJP spokesperson against our beloved Holy Prophet PBUH. Instead of showing sensitivity to their Muslim citizens who, along with Muslims worldwide were deeply hurt"
2022-06-12 08:02:52+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Given the special needs of tribal districts my govt had increased their  funding by 3x to Rs 131 bn.Imported 
Govt has budgeted only Rs 110bn, reduced dev funding, 0 allocation for displaced persons &amp; 0 increase in current budget.Shows incompetence &amp; ill intent of govt of crooks."
2022-06-10 17:12:56+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"And on the other hand retard economic growth due to high interest rates. All our progressive tax reforms and Pro-poor programs such as Sehat card, Kamyab Pakistan are being shelved. It is an unimaginative, Purana Pakistan budget creating more burdens &amp; misery for the nation."
2022-06-10 17:12:56+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,We reject this anti people &amp; anti business budget presented by Imported govt. Budget is based on unrealistic assumptions on inflation(11.5%) &amp; economic growth(5%). Today's SPI of 24% indicates that inflation will be between 25/30% which on the one hand will destroy the common man
2022-06-09 15:19:05+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Saddened to learn of the passing of our MNA Aamir Liaquat. My condolences and prayers go to his family.
2022-06-05 17:16:33+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,This attack on our Holy Prophet PBUH is the most painful thing anyone can do to Muslims who feel an intense love &amp; reverence for our Holy Prophet PBUH. OIC must take strong action ag Modi's India bec sadly so far India has been allowed to get away with its Islamophobic policies.
2022-06-05 17:16:32+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Strongly condemn the hateful attack by a BJP spokesperson on our beloved Holy Prophet PBUH. Modi govt has been deliberately following a policy of provocation &amp; hatred towards Muslims in India including inciting vigilante violence against them.
2022-06-03 06:51:31+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"This afternoon I will be addressing a jalsa in Buner where I will be pointing out how Imported govt is a willing tool being used by US regime change conspirators, esp those foreign interests who want to cause economic chaos &amp; hardship for our people &amp; weaken the state of Pakistan"
2022-06-02 17:42:34+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,I want everyone to come out &amp; protest peacefully after Juma prayers tomorrow against this Imported govt's anti-people policies of massive price hikes to crush the public &amp; wreak economic havoc in the country since they have no stakes here as their assets are all abroad.
2022-06-02 17:28:22+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Our govt sustained pressure of Covid &amp; gave Rs 1200 bn worth economic package. This yr alone we reduced sales tax to zero percent &amp; additionally provided Rs 466 bn energy subsidies to protect our public. For us our priority has always been our people.
2022-06-02 17:28:21+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Imported govt has increased petroleum prices by 40% or Rs 60 per litre.This will increase burden on the public by Rs 900 bn &amp; price hike in basic necessities. Plus, the Rs 8 increase in electricity price will put entire country into shock.Expect inflation by 30% highest in 75 yrs"
2022-06-02 17:06:13+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,This cabal of crooks poses a far more serious threat to Pakistan than any of our external enemies.
2022-05-31 14:22:00+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"The NAB bill amendment is basically an NRO &amp; will destroy the anti corruption drive in Pakistan for all times to come. All cases against NS, SS &amp; AZ will be closed &amp;a new round of mega corruption will commence."
2022-05-31 14:21:59+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"SCP must take suo moto notice to ensure fair trial by appointing a monitoring judge to oversee all mega cases of politicians. As it is, 5 months have passed &amp; FIA Court has failed to frame charges. This speaks volumes for how big thieves exploit &amp; manipulate the system."
2022-05-31 14:21:59+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,SCP was brazenly lied to by FIA when they stated before the SCP that Special Prosecutors were laid off as they remained absent when in fact Special  Prosecutors had been present on aĺl dates before the FIA Court.
2022-05-31 14:21:58+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Crime Minister trying to interfere in his &amp; his family's money laundering cases by altering record thru friendly prosecution. FIA on behest of Crime Minister has taken back challan for supplementary reference for altering it to destroy the case in toto.
2022-05-30 03:06:45+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"What I witnessed during my 7 hours on the container btwn 1am &amp; 8am on 26th morning confirmed what I had been sensing, since this Imported govt was imposed on us through a foreign conspiracy, that Pakistan has changed forever.The mental shackles of slavery have been broken finally"
2022-05-29 07:06:17+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Congratulations to Kazim Khan on being re-elected President of CPNE. I believe CPNE can play a major role in responsible journalism and will protect people’s right to know and freedom of speech.
2022-05-26 18:18:30+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"In contrast India, strategic ally of US, has managed to reduce fuel prices by Pkr 25 per litre by buying cheaper oil from Russia. Now our nation will suffer another massive dose of inflation at the hands of this cabal of crooks."
2022-05-26 18:18:29+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Nation starting to pay price for Imported govt's subservience before foreign masters with 20% / Rs30 per litre hike in petrol &amp; diesel prices - the highest single price hike in our history.The incompetent &amp; insensitive Govt has not pursued our deal with Russia for 30% cheaper oil
2022-05-26 15:29:01+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"My heartfelt condolences go to the families of our two martyred PTI workers, Faisal Abbas Chaudhry from Lahore &amp; Syed Ahmed Jan from Mardan as a result of Punjab police violence during our peaceful Azadi March. PTI will take full financial responsibility for their families."
2022-05-25 10:43:20+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Rumours &amp; delib disinfo that a deal has been done. Absolutely not! We are moving towards Islamabad &amp; no question of any deal.

2022-05-24 11:17:26+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Strongly condemn the continuing fascist tactics of Modi govt against Kashmiri leader Yasin Malik from his illegal imprisonment to his conviction on fake charges. International community must act against the Hindutva fascist Modi regime's state terrorism in IIOJK.
2022-05-23 20:35:50+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"PPP, PMLN and JUI Marches against our govt were never stopped nor did we carry out any crackdown on their  workers. This is the difference between democrats and kleptocrats."
2022-05-23 20:13:22+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Already economy is in a tailspin. I want to warn the crooks &amp; their handlers that these undemocratic &amp; fascist steps will further exacerbate the economic situation &amp; push the country into a state of anarchy.
2022-05-23 20:13:21+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Peaceful protest is the right of all our citizens. The brutal crackdown on PTI ldrs &amp; workers in Punjab &amp; Islamabad has once again shown us what we are familiar with - the fascist nature of PMLN when in power. The present crackdown also raises serious questions abt the Handlers.
2022-05-22 13:55:42+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"I strongly condemn the political victimisation of journalists Arshad Sharif, Sami Ibrahim, Imran Riaz Khan through fake FIRs by the Imported government brought in through US regime change conspiracy. This is absolutely unacceptable."

2022-05-02 11:11:50+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"After this reaffirmation of US regime change conspiracy that was evident from the cipher message sent by our Envoy in Washington conveying State Dept Lu's threat, it is surely duty of CJP to form Commission to hold public hearings on who all were involved here in this conspiracy."

2021-07-06 11:52:25+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Next week Cabinet will decide on a comprehensive policy in this regard. We will put an end to the colonial legacy of pomp &amp; glory used to overwhelm the people.
2021-07-06 11:52:24+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"To save taxpayer money &amp; avoid inconvenience to the public I will not be going to any private function with protocol &amp; security. I am also reviewing protocol &amp; security for ministers, governors &amp; PTI CMs to decide how we can minimise expenditure &amp; end public inconvenience."
2021-07-04 13:33:10+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"This coordination led to identifying the terrorists &amp; their international linkages. Again, planning &amp; financing of this heinous terror attack has links to Indian sponsorship of terrorism against Pak.  Global community must mobilise int institutions against this rogue behaviour"
2021-07-04 13:33:10+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"I instructed my team to brief nation on findings of Johar Town, Lahore blast investigation today.

2021-06-04 03:31:58+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"With financial stability achieved, it's time to accelerate transformation of Islamabad into a model city with priority being on reform &amp; restructuring. Other mega cities can also become self-sustaining economic engines of growth through commitment, transparency &amp; innovation."
2021-06-04 03:31:57+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Our economic turnaround &amp; success of our construction policy showing results in diff sectors. Pak is changing.

2021-05-26 04:10:57+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"The same contrast is there in NAB's performance. Between 2018-2020 of our govt's tenure NAB recovered Rs 484 bn in contrast to only Rs 290 bn recovered during 1999 - 2017. When govt doesn't protect criminals &amp; allows accountability to work without interference, results achieved"
2021-05-26 04:10:57+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,State land worth Rs.192 bn recovered as compared to Rs 2.6 bn worth state land recovery under PMLN's 10 yrs.

2021-05-13 08:00:39+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Eid Mubarak to our Muslim Ummah. This is a very different Eid which we must celebrate in a quiet manner with our families, for 2 imp reasons. One: there is the Corona pandemic. In Pak we are now again beginning to control the spread so it is vital for our ppl to observe SOPs."
2021-05-09 10:54:59+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Strongly condemn Israeli Forces' attack esp during Ramazan on Palestinians in Qibla-e-Awaal, Al-Aqsa Mosque, violating all norms of humanity &amp; int law. We reiterate support for Palestinian ppl. Int community must take immed action to protect Palestinians &amp; their legitimate rights"
2021-05-06 18:40:54+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,A great development as Amazon has finally approved that our sellers can export their goods through their system.

2021-05-05 19:38:42+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Deeply saddened by demise of Kashmiri ldr Ashraf Sehrai in illegal Indian custody.

2021-05-01 09:53:54+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Trump's team did everything to dispute 2020 presidential election result; but bec technology used in electoral process not one irregularity was found. For a year now we have been asking the Opposition to cooperate with us &amp; help reform our present electoral system.
2021-05-01 09:53:53+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Unfortunately no substantive reforms were put in place. Technology &amp; use of Electronic Voting Machines are the only answer to reclaim credibility of elections. I invite the Opposition to sit with us &amp; select from EVM models we have available to restore our elections credibility.
2021-05-01 09:53:53+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,In 2013 there were 133 NA constituencies' disputes before elec tribunals. We asked for examination of just 4 constituencies' votes &amp; in all 4 rigging was established. But it took us a yr &amp; a 126-days dharna to get a Judicial Comm which found over 40 faults in conduct of elections
2021-05-01 09:53:52+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"In NA 249 bye election, despite a low turnout, all parties are crying foul &amp; claiming rigging. Same happened in Daska recently &amp; in Senate elections. In fact, apart from 1970 election, in every election claims of rigging have raised doubts over credibility of election results."
2021-05-01 03:34:13+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,I commend FBR efforts on achieving growth of 57% in April 2021 with collections recorded at Rs.384 bn compared to Rs.240 bn in April 2020. During Jul-Apr collections reached Rs.3780 bn - 14% higher than same period last yr. Shows our policies have led to broad-based econ revival.
2021-04-25 18:38:13+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Congratulations to PTI on its 25th birthday.

Sadly all three are no longer with us."
2021-04-24 07:52:34+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,I want to express our solidarity with the people of India as they battle a dangerous wave of COVID-19.

2021-04-19 17:12:06+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Saddened to learn of the passing of former IG Police Nasir Durrani. My condolences and prayers go to his family. He was instrumental in reforming KP police when he was the IG. Pakistan has lost an outstanding police officer.
2021-04-17 06:51:52+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,I also call on Western govts who have outlawed any negative comment on the holocaust to use the same standards to penalise those deliberately spreading their message of hate against Muslims by abusing our Prophet PBUH.
2021-04-17 06:51:52+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Those in the West, incl extreme right politicians, who deliberately indulge in such abuse &amp; hate under guise of freedom of speech clearly lack moral sense &amp; courage to apologise to the 1.3 bn Muslims for causing this hurt. We demand an apology from these extremists."
2021-04-17 06:51:21+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,My message to extremists abroad who indulge in Islamophobia &amp; racist slurs to hurt &amp; cause pain to 1.3 bn Muslims across the globe: We Muslims have the greatest love &amp; respect for our Prophet PBUH who lives in our hearts. We cannot tolerate any such disrespect &amp; abuse.
2021-04-17 06:50:01+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Let me make clear to people here &amp; abroad: Our govt only took action against TLP under our anti-terrorist law when they challenged the writ of the state and used street violence &amp; attacking the public &amp; law enforcers. No one can be above the law and the Constitution.
2021-04-16 11:39:20+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,I want to pay special tribute to our police force for their heroic stand against organised violence intended to create chaos to blackmail govt. 4 policemen were martyred &amp; over 600 injured.

2021-04-12 09:07:17+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"customs, banks, port authorities, shipping companies &amp; brokers etc. An indep authority will manage the PSW which will be pivotal in unlocking Pakistan’s potential to become a hub for international transit &amp; trade."
2021-04-12 09:07:16+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Another landmark reform by PTI govt -  the Pakistan Single Window (PSW) Act 2021. It paves the way for ease in imports &amp; exports. PSW will bring $500 mn annual savings &amp; reduce cargo clearance time from days to hrs by integrating 75 regulatory depts:
2021-04-12 04:03:39+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"The love &amp; commitment of Overseas Pakistanis to Pakistan is unparalleled.   You sent over $2bn for 10 straight mths despite Covid, breaking all records. Your remittances rose to $2.7bn in Mar, 43% higher than last yr. So far this fiscal yr, your remittances rose 26%. We thank you"
2021-04-09 13:56:34+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"My condolences on the demise of HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Britain has lost a wise elder who was imbued with a unique spirit of public service. His role in promoting Pakistan-UK relations will always be remembered."
2021-04-04 17:03:49+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Strongly condemn the murder of ATC judge Aftab Afridi, his wife &amp; 2 children at Anbar Interchange, Swabi. The perpetrators of this gruesome act will be apprehended &amp; dealt with full severity of the law."
2021-04-04 03:43:33+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Wishing all our Christian citizens a happy Easter.
2021-04-03 06:22:26+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,I have already laid out priorities for the UN Climate Change Conference 2021 - COP26 - if the international community is serious about countering impact of climate change.
2021-04-03 06:22:25+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Hence our initiatives of Green Pak, 10 bn-tree tsunami, nature based solutions, cleaning up our rivers etc. We have gained vast experience in 7 yrs, beg with KP, &amp; our policies are being recognised &amp; lauded. We are ready to help any state wanting to learn from our experience."
2021-04-03 06:22:24+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,I am puzzled at the cacophony over Pak not being invited to a climate change conf! My govt's environment policies are driven solely by our commitment to our future generations of a clean &amp; green Pakistan to mitigate the impact of climate change.
2021-03-31 13:30:22+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"I commend FBR efforts, achieving historic growth of 41% in March '21 with collections recorded at Rs.460 bn.

2021-03-23 11:47:23+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"So far we have been unable to achieve our great potential because we lost sight of our Quaid's vision. Today Pakistan is back on track to realise that ideal by bringing the powerful under rule of law &amp; setting up a welfare state with our progs of Ehsaas, Panagahs &amp; health cards."
2021-03-23 11:47:22+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"When Muslims moved away from these guiding principles, their civilisation decayed &amp; declined. 81 yrs ago today our Quaid gave us the dream for Pakistan as envisioned by the great philosopher and poet Iqbal &amp; based on these Riyasat-i-Madina principles."
2021-03-23 11:47:22+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"15 centuries ago our Holy Prophet PBUH set up the first welfare state in Madina: based on rule of law, meritocracy, compassion &amp; tolerance; &amp; where quest for knowledge was made a sacred duty. In a couple of decades Muslims became the greatest civilisation for next few centuries."
2021-03-22 16:14:45+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"It is a gt achievement bec this time the Hospital was surveyed against new &amp; far more stringent standards set by the JCI in its 7th edition of standards. Presently, there are fewer than fifty hospitals in the entire world that have been judged against these exacting measures."
2021-03-22 16:14:44+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Congratulations to SKM team for another milestone. SKMCH&amp;RC Lhr has been re-accredited by US Joint Commission International. Delighted our world-class services have again been internationally recognised. Our team maintained high quality standards even during the COVID pandemic.

2021-03-13 04:56:45+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Congratulations to Sadiq Sanjrani &amp; Mirza Mohammad Afridi on winning Senate Chairman &amp; Dy Chairman elections. I am happy Balochistan &amp; former FATA got these two slots in line with my policy of mainstreaming those parts of Pak that have been marginalised or left behind in the past
2021-02-28 15:03:43+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,For developing countries like Pakistan there are lessons to be learnt. With determination and commitment we can do the same for our people.
2021-02-28 15:03:42+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,I want to congratulate President Xi Jinping &amp; the Chinese govt for the momentous achievement of eradicating extreme poverty in their country. Never before in history have 750 million people been taken out of extreme poverty in a span of 35 years.
2021-02-27 03:22:15+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,I welcome restoration of the ceasefire along the LOC. The onus of creating an enabling environment for further progress rests with India. India must take necessary steps to meet the long-standing demand &amp; right of the Kashmiri people to self determination acc to UNSC resolutions.
2021-02-27 03:22:15+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"We also demonstrated to the world Pakistan’s responsible behaviour in the face of India's irresponsible military brinkmanship, by returning the captured Indian pilot. We have always stood for peace &amp; remain ready to move forward to resolve all outstanding issues through dialogue."
2021-02-27 03:22:14+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"I congratulate the entire nation &amp; salute our Armed Forces on the 2nd Anniversary of our response to India's illegal, reckless military adventure of air strikes against Pakistan.

2021-02-23 17:36:36+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,It's a pleasure to be back in Sri Lanka again. My earlier two visits were on cricket tours in '75 &amp; '86 where I witnessed the evolution of Sri Lankan cricket. Today I enjoyed the welcoming hospitality of Sri Lankan PM @PresRajapaksa.
2021-02-22 17:01:08+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"We will always seek to strengthen a fair and free election process. Unfortunately others lack this commitment. When we wanted 4 constituencies opened after the 2013 elections, it took us over two years."
2021-02-22 16:50:35+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,It is because we want transparency that we are seeking open ballot for Senate elections.
2021-02-22 16:50:34+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Have always struggled for fair &amp; free elections. So even though there is no legal compulsion to do so before ECP announces results, I would request our PTI candidate to ask for re-polling in the 20 polling stations Opposition is crying hoarse over in the Daska NA 75 bye- election"
2021-02-20 10:16:10+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Thank you for your invitation Prime Minister @PresRajapaksa. Looking forward to my visit to 🇱🇰 to further strengthen the friendship &amp; cooperation between our two countries🇵🇰-🇱🇰.
2021-02-20 05:35:35+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Also commend FBR Headoffice Team for developing the IT-enabled Transformation Plan &amp; procuring cutting-edge Track &amp; Trace System. Once fully functional in July 2021, it would add 100s of billions of additional revenue, curb counterfeiting and help establish rule of law."
2021-02-20 05:35:34+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"I commend FBR Field Formations on achieving 7-months revenue targets by undertaking bold tax audit and enforcement, and counter-smuggling measures. They must continue working with honesty and commitment."
2021-02-16 14:09:50+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"I want to thank our Overseas Pakistanis for responding so strongly to SBP’s #RoshanDigitalAccounts. 87,833 accounts opened from 97 countries around the world. $500 million sent to Pakistan in just 5 months. Momentum continues to rise with $243 million coming in last 6 weeks alone"
2021-02-15 04:44:03+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Good news from industrial sector also, showing sustained growth. Large scale manufacturing saw another double digit growth month in December 2020 -  11.4% growth vs Dec 2019. Cumulative July to Dec growth above 8% now."
2021-02-15 04:44:01+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Remittances from overseas Pakistanis were $2.27 bn in Jan, up 19% over Jan 2020 - 8th consecutive month of remittances above $2b.

2021-02-10 14:27:52+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,We welcome Sri Lankan PM Mahinda Rajapaksa's assurance given in Sri Lankan Parliament today allowing Muslims to bury those who died from COVID19.
2021-02-09 13:58:22+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,This is what the PDM cabal wants to now protect by supporting a corruption-friendly system. We are determined to stop this cycle of corruption &amp; money laundering that is debilitating the nation.

2019-10-18 09:39:21+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,75 days &amp; Occupation government of Modi continues the siege in IOJK.

2019-09-05 15:04:09+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"The world cannot feign ignorance as it did at Munich in 1938. The fascist, Hindu-Supremacist design of the Modi Govt with its ethnic cleansing &amp; genocide of Muslims' agenda in IOJK, in India itself (Assam) &amp; beyond into AJK is now overt for all the world to see."
2019-09-05 14:49:56+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,India's violation of all international laws including humanitarian laws is there for the world to see. So why is the world silent?

2019-08-17 07:42:45+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,I welcome the UNSC meeting to discuss the serious situation in Occupied Jammu &amp; Kashmir. It is for the first time in over 50 yrs that the world’s highest diplomatic forum has taken up this issue. There are 11 UNSC resolutions reiterating the Kashmiris right to self determination.
2019-08-16 06:21:25+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,That is why the Hindutva exclusivist creed of the Modi-led Govt with its fascist tactics in IOK will fail miserably in its attempt to smother the Kashmiri liberation struggle.
2019-08-16 06:21:24+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"The fascist, Hindu Supremacist Modi Govt should know that while armies, militants &amp; terrorists can be defeated by superior forces; history tells us that when a nation unites in a freedom struggle &amp; does not fear death, no force can stop it from achieving its goal."

2019-08-11 07:58:56+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"I am afraid this RSS ideology of Hindu Supremacy, like the Nazi Aryan Supremacy, will not stop in IOK; instead it will lead to suppression of Muslims in India &amp; eventually lead to targeting of Pakistan. The Hindu Supremacists version of Hitler's Lebensraum."
2019-08-11 07:58:56+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"The curfew, crackdown &amp; impending genocide of Kashmiris in IOK is unfolding exactly acc to RSS ideology inspired by Nazi ideology. Attempt is to change demography of Kashmir through ethnic cleansing. Question is: Will the world watch &amp; appease as they did Hitler at Munich?"
2019-08-08 13:58:24+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"What should be obvious is the int community will be witnessing the genocide of the Kashmiris in IOK. Question is: Will we watch another appeasement of fascism, this time in the garb of BJP govt, or will the int community have the moral courage to stop this from happening?"
2019-08-08 13:58:23+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"The whole world is waiting to see what happens to oppressed Kashmiris in IOK when curfew is lifted. Does the BJP govt think by using greater military force against Kashmiris in IOK, it will stop the freedom movement? Chances are it will gain momentum."
2019-08-04 10:34:57+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,President Trump offered to mediate on Kashmir. This is the time to do so as situation deteriorates there and along the LOC with new aggressive actions being taken by Indian occupation forces. This has the potential to blow up into a regional crisis.
2019-08-04 10:34:56+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,It is time to end the long night of suffering for the people of Occupied Kashmir. They must be allowed to exercise their right to self determination according to UN SC resolutions.The only road to peace &amp; security in South Asia runs through a peaceful &amp; just settlement of Kashmir

2019-06-16 06:55:15+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"4/5 1. In order ro have a winning offensive strategy Sarfaraz must go in with specialist batsmen and bowlers because ""Raillu Kattas"" rarely perform under pressure - especially the intense kind that will be generated today. 2. Unless pitch is damp, Sarfaraz must win the toss &amp; bat"
2019-06-16 06:54:55+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,3/5 All fears of losing should be banished from the mind as the mind can only process one thought at a time.

2019-06-16 06:53:16+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"2/5 Today, given the intensity of the match, both teams will come under great mental pressure and the power of the mind will decide the outcome of the match today.

2018-05-08 05:34:25+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Strongly condemn the attack on PTI workers by PPP at our jalsagah camp in Karachi yesterday. Sindh govt must take action against those who used violence against our workers. Strong arm tactics by PPP reflects their fear of PTI's rising popularity in Sindh.

2018-04-20 08:21:53+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,"Appreciate CJP's praise for KP IGP &amp; CS. When competent officers are appointed solely on merit, as in KP, the Police &amp; Administration work effectively. In contrast, Punjab &amp; Sindh have seen nepotism flourish with appts made on personal affinities of loyalists and ""yes men""."

2018-04-15 07:39:33+00:00,ImranKhanPTI,Strongly condemn the firing at Justice Ijaz ul Ahsan's house. These Sicilian-mafia-like tactics to pressurise senior judiciary are unacceptable in any democracy.
