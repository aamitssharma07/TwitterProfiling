        "In this project, I used both  OpenAI(gpt-3.5-turbo-0125) and Lama(llama-3.1-70b-versatile) to profile **eight users** based on their tweets, aiming to infer personal traits such as likes, dislikes, hobbies etc. The generated profiles were compared with publicly available information, revealing that while the LLM accurately identified several traits, there were notable gaps due to the limited dataset. These gaps resulted from the insufficient number and variety of tweets, leading to incomplete profiles. The accuracy and detail of the profiling were found to be heavily dependent on the diversity and richness of the tweet data. Users with more varied tweets had more accurate profiles, whereas those with fewer tweets had less detailed profiles. This underscores the importance of having a comprehensive dataset for effective social media analysis. Future efforts should focus on expanding the dataset to improve the accuracy and completeness of user profiling."
