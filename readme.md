# Twitter Profiling Using Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Overview

This project aims to develop a system for profiling Twitter users by analyzing their tweets. With the increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs), this system leverages their capability to process vast amounts of text data, enabling in-depth analysis of Twitter users' posts, interactions, and networks. The ultimate goal is to extract valuable attributes such as hobbies, likes, dislikes, and personality traits, which can be used to provide more effective services and personalized content.

## Features

- **User Profiling**: Analyze tweets to determine personal attributes like hobbies, likes, dislikes, and personality traits.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Evaluate the sentiment behind tweets to understand the user's emotional tone.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Identify patterns in tweeting behavior, such as activity times and engagement with other users.
- **Content Recommendation**: Utilize the extracted data to suggest personalized content and services.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the system.
- **OpenAI Model (gpt-3.5-turbo-0125)**: Utilized for natural language understanding and generating user profiles based on tweet analysis.
- **LLama (llama-3.1-70b-versatile)**: Employed as an additional LLM to complement and enhance the analysis capabilities of the system.
